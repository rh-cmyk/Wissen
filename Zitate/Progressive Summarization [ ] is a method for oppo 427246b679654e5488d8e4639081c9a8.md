#quote  "Progressive Summarization [...] is a method for opportunistic compression â€” summarizing and condensing a piece of information in small spurts, spread across time, in the course of other work, and only doing as much or as little as the information deserves. [...] You have to summarize the note without knowing what it will be used for." (Forte 2017:6)
