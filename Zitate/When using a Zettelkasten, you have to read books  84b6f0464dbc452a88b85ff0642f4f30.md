#quote  "When using a Zettelkasten, you have to read books differently. Instead of reading a book from cover to cover, you iterate over the book and each time drills down to the parts of the book that you will eventually read with a purpose - the purpose of careful reading while taking notes and integrating these into your Zettelkasten. The four stages of reading a book for your Zettelkasten are: 1. Get a feel for the book by looking at the headlines. 2. Decide what you want to learn from the book. 3. Skim the paragraphs to find out the interesting ones. 4. Take note of interesting passages." (Eriksson 2015:2)
