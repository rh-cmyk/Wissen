#quote  "In incremental reading, interrupted reading is a rule, not an exception […] The main role of interruption is to prevent the decline in the quality of reading. Use the following criteria to decide when to stop reading the article: lack of time: if you still have many articles for review for a given day and your time is running out, keep your increments shorter. […] boredom […] lack of understanding […] lower priority […] overload: if you have a long queue of articles to read, you will naturally read in smaller portions" (Wozniak :6)
