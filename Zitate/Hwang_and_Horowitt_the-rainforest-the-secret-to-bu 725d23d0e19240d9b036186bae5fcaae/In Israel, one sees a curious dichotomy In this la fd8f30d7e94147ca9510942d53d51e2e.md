# "In Israel, one sees a curious dichotomy. In this land of intense zero-sum games, the technology startup industry behaves differently. It is a community within a community, with its own internal rules of behavior and its own sense of trust. In an ocean of zero-sum games, it is a cultural island that thrives on positive-sum transactions." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:136)
