# "At the start of every episode of entrepreneurial innovation, there is no outward form. Every company in the beginning is just a group of disparate people with an informally arranged set of ideas. There is no corporate entity in the beginning―there is only a vision of what is possible. As Stanford's Ade Mabogunje would say, "A company is not a thing. It is an event." Although we often treat companies as tangible entities, in Rainforests we think of companies as nothing more than transitory moments of human organization. If we view enterprise creation as a human relationship process―an event―then we gain a profound insight into the "big bang" of innovation." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:101)
