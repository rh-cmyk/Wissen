# "Being an entrepreneur is one of the loneliest jobs in the world. One must routinely put on a brave smile, even in the hardest of times, and remain calm, optimistic, and encouraging with customers, investors, employees, and any number of other partners and colleagues. Having access to a Rainforest of supportive, skilled people―including keystones―often means the difference between success and failure for struggling entrepreneurs." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:86)
