# "Innovation, as it exists in modern communities like Silicon Valley, is a team sport. It cannot rely on exchanges of goods or ideas solely between disparate individuals. Therefore, we must explore new frontiers beyond the old terrain of exchange and specialization. What happens, for instance, if parties need to exchange ideas and skills that are not learned in years, but which require a lifetime to master? Or what if the ideas and skills are so extraordinary that there are only a handful of people in the entire world who possess them? What if there is only one person in the world with a particular skill? In such cases, it does not seem useful or even accurate to say that we are merely making exchanges to save labor."
