# "what we have learned through years of working with entrepreneurs around the world is that when it comes to innovation, the unbridled free market is not as productive as conventional wisdom says it should be. We found that a recipe employing a laissez-faire approach―in short, to simply let the ingredients do their thing―is really no recipe at all. The marketplace has not worked its magic in most parts of the U.S. and the world, even where entrepreneurs are unhindered by government interference. The vast majority of the planet's venture capital and its fastest-growing startup companies are concentrated in just a few unique places." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:31)
