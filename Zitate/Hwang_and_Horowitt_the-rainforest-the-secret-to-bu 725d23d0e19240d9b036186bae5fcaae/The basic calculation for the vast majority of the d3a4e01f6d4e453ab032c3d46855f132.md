# "The basic calculation for the vast majority of the billions of people in the world is that innovative behavior is simply not worth it. […] Innovative behavior is not driven by rational maximization, as neoclassical economists would argue. […] Dan Pink has pointed out that, beyond a basic level of survival, human beings actually are less creative when they are incentivized by more financial reward. Economic research is also generating increasing evidence that is counter-intuitive: As long as the task involved only mechanical skill, bonuses worked as they would be expected: the higher the pay, the better the performance. But once the task called for 'even rudimentary cognitive skill,' a larger reward 'led to poorer performance.' Once someone has enough income to live, additional financial incentives can cause that person to turn off their creative brains in favor of repetitive actions that do not require creativity―like laboratory rats taught to push a lever to get more food."
