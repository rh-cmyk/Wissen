# "Ronald Coase has long argued that in order to understand the system-level economic effects of a human network, it is important to understand the actual behavior and incentives of individual actors within the system. He disdains "blackboard economics" and believes that economists tend to be too theoretical and do not pay enough attention to the details of day-to-day activity. 25 Following his line of thinking, the financial crisis of 2008 might have been preventable if economists had actually understood the specific banking transactions that were at the heart of the crisis. 26 In this book, we apply the same thinking with regard to innovationâ€•you cannot understand the macro without understanding the micro."
