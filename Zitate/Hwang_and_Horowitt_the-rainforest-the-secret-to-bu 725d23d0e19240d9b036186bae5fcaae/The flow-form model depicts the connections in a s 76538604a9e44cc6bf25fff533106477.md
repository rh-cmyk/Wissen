# "The flow-form model depicts the connections in a social network as the movement of fluids in tubes, as in a mycelium network. As Tesson describes: The "flow-form model" contrasts at a profound level with conventional models of communicative networks, which are often presented as systems of interconnected nodes, and it offers a radically different way of conceptualizing how a networked structure could behave. The flow-form model therefore represents a shift away from the nodecentered thinking of conventional network theory, towards an understanding of networks as representations of communicative flow.""
