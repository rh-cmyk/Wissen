# "Conventional free market theory insists that innovation happens naturally when society is mostly left to itself. […] We can call this a passive free market model, which reflects the belief that it is what society does not do that drives economic output. Our work, however, leads us to believe in the potential value of an active free market model―one in which society uses targeted, cost-efficient interventions to enhance the efficiency of the market by helping people bridge social distances that currently hinder innovation."
