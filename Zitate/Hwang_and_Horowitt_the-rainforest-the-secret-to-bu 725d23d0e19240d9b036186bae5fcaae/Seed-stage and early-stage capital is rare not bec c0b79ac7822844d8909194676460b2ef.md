# "Seed-stage and early-stage capital is rare not because there aren't enough great opportunities. It is rare because of the limitations inherent in the process of enterprise creation, capital aggregation, deal structuring, and human motivation. However, there are still great companies to be built. That is why there has always been a need for subsidized capital to fill the gap. Subsidized capital can come from a government or a corporate sponsor, but its purpose is the sameâ€•to create a financial bridge for innovation, so that opportunities can move from the left side of the diagram to the point at which the risk-reward equation finally enables the profit mechanism to take over sustainably" (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:204)
