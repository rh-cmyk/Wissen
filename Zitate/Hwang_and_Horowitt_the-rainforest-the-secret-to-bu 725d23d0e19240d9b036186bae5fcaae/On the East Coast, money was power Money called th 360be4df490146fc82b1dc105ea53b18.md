# "On the East Coast, money was power. Money called the shots. You see this behavior on Wall Street. You see it everywhere in fact. In most places in the world, the presumption in business is that money dominates and sets the rules. But the West Coast was different. "In Boston, it was the entrepreneurs who dressed nicely and showed up on time to impress the investors," Phil remembers. "In Silicon Valley, it was the opposite." 2 Why this difference? Where did it come from? The role of money on the West Coast had followed a different path. Forged in the egalitarian culture of the American frontier―where what you could do mattered more than what you owned or where you came from―capital was just one component in the complex tapestry of the economic landscape. Money did not confer inherent entitlement or hierarchy, as it might elsewhere. Money was considered a tool. The venture capital industry that evolved on the West Coast inherited that belief. As Phil observes, "Look at what venture capital really is. It's just a service industry to entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley have figured out that they are the real gems and that the money itself is just a commodity. They have a 'buying' mentality."" (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:197)
