# "Individualism is a fine idea in theory, until one has to face the realities of finding food, water, clothing, shelter, information, protection, and human companionship. Despite common stereotypes, evidence shows that the frontier was not full of Lone Ranger types. Rather, it consisted largely of individuals and families who had to build social networks, traveling groups, small communities, and frontier posts to help them clear land, plant crops, sell goods, and exchange with one another. Just as in the startup world, individualists had to "get along" to survive, and new types of communities were formed." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:141)
