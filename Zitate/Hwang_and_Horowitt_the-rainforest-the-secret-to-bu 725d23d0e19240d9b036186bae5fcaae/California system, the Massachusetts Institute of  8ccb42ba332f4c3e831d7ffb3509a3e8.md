# "California system, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and many leading academic institutions in the American heartland―were initially founded with a focus on agricultural studies. The goal was to help farmers learn how to apply technologies to boost their output. The Morrill Land-Grants Acts of 1862 and 1890 used proceeds from the sale of federal land to provide every U.S. state with funds to establish agricultural colleges. Altogether, 106 colleges were launched with the goal of increasing America's agricultural capacity. To disseminate that knowledge even further, the cooperative extension program―funded by the Smith-Lever Act of 1914―helped universities hire agents to teach those ideas to still more farmers and to take those technologies directly to the farms. It was the original model for technology transfer―innovation as a controlled production and distribution process from university to user." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:37)
