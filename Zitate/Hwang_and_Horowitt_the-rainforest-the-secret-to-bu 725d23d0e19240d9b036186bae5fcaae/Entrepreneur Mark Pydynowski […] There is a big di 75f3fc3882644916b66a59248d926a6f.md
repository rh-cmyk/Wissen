# "Entrepreneur Mark Pydynowski [â€¦] There is a big difference when I talk with entrepreneurs in California and those in the Midwest. In California, people are generally willing to share a lot about their ideas. In the Midwest, entrepreneurs who seek me out for advice are often not willing to tell me anything about what they are doing. They are so afraid of sharing that they end up hurting themselves."
