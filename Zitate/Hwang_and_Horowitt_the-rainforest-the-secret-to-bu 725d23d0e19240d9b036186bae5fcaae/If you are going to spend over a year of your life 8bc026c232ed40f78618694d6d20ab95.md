# "If you are going to spend over a year of your life raising money without getting paid for it, you might as well invest large amounts of money at a time and get the biggest leverage possible to make it worthwhile. Thus, few venture capitalists are willing to invest relatively small amounts in companies that are still proving their underlying technology or developing their first product. It is too hard to organize a venture fund only to "waste it" on such small deals." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:202)
