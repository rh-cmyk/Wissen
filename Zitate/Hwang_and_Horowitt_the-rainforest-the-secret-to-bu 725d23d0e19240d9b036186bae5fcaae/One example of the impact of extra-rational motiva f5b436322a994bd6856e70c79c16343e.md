# "One example of the impact of extra-rational motivations is evident when governments, corporations, or foundations issue prizes or challenge grants to achieve technical milestones. Teams that compete for those prizes frequently spend more than the amount of the prize itself. Shaifali Puri, the Executive Director of Scientists Without Borders, recently held a challenge in which the participants invested a total of sixteen times the value of the actual prize money."
