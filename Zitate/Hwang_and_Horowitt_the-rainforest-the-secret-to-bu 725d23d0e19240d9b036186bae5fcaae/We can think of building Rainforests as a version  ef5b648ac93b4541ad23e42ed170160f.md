# "We can think of building Rainforests as a version of cognitive behavioral therapy. […] CBT works by correcting what psychologists call cognitive distortion. Cognitive distortion happens when we interpret actions of others through biased lenses […] Over time, the brain's patterns of behavior can be rewired through self-awareness and real-world validation of certain behaviors as opposed to other behaviors." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:183)
