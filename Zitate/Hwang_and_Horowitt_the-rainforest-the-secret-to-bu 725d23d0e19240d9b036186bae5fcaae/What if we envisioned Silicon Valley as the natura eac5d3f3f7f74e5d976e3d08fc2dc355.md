# "What if we envisioned Silicon Valley as the natural endpoint of a 50,000-year story? Perhaps it could be the latest stage in the evolution of human society, from a culture based on tribes to a culture based on pragmatic individuals. […] The California coast is arguably the furthest point one can travel from the roots of human civilization, from the ties that bound people to the past, and from the rules of behavior imposed by our ancestors' experiences. Silicon Valley happened exactly when and where it should have happened―at the end of the story so far. California today consists largely of people, or their descendants, who are such individualists that they could not even fit into an entire nation of rebels. It is the world's ultimate non-tribe. But people still have to learn to "get along." Even today, people who move to Silicon Valley are surprised at the ease of starting conversations with new people, the lack of hierarchy, the openness to sharing information and ideas, the willingness to collaborate, the tolerance for mistakes, and the rapid style in which new ideas are embraced and attempted."
