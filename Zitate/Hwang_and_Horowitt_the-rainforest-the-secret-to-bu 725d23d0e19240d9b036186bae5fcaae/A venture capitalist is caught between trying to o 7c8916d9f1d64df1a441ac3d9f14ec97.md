# "A venture capitalist is caught between trying to own as much of a company as possible and trying to leave enough equity in the hands of the entrepreneurial team to keep them fully incentivized to work for the company's success. Furthermore, a venture capitalist wants to preserve a reputation for treating entrepreneurs and other investors fairly in order to make sure that future promising companies will seek his capital."
