# "the term "venture capital" was originally derived from wealthy businessman Jock Whitney's idea that this money was intended as "private adventure capital." [â€¦] The early venture capitalists in the Valley were a lot like cowboys. Many of them had frontier-style mindsets. Much of the industry as we know it today started in the 1950s and 1960s from a small, informal group of young, not-so-wealthy individual investors in San Francisco. As Bill Edwards, one of the original members of the group, recalls, "None of us had enough money to do an investment by ourselves, so we had to have help." The entire venture capital industry in Silicon Valley raised only $10 million in 1975." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:212)
