# "In theory, as a company matures, the valuation should increase, and the same amount of stock should cost more to purchase. In practice, however, we know this theory breaks down in the earliest stages of startups. An additional share of stock purchased by an investor can be offset by additional disincentive for entrepreneurs, which lowers the odds of success for everyone. There is an invisible cost to owning more stock in an early-stage company. The most stock a venture capital investor can own is a "fair" amount, as perceived by the entrepreneurial team. After that, each dollar more invested is undercutting the value of the prior dollar invested. At some point, you cannot squeeze any more juice out of the orange. So, the investor has a great incentive to wait. Earlier risk does not yield a commensurate reward. In later stages, after the total value of a company has grown, even a smaller relative percentage can be enough to motivate a team, so the problem diminishes. Higher risk in early-stage venture capital is not rewarded the way one would expect in the bond markets or the public stock markets." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:202)
