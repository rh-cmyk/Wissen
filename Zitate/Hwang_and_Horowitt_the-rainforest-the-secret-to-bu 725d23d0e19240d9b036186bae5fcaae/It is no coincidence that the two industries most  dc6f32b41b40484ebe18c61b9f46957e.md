# "It is no coincidence that the two industries most identified with California―Hollywood and Silicon Valley―are both industries that are by definition impermanent. They both require an environment that enables people to band together quickly for a specific purpose―whether a movie, a television show, or a startup company―and then disband until they reunite for the next project. Or perhaps they never meet again. A major Hollywood film, for example, can require thousands of people entering into a temporary partnership" (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:114)
