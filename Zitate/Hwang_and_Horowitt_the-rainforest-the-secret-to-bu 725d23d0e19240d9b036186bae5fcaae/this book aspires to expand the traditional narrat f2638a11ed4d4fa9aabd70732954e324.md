# "this book aspires to expand the traditional narrative focusing on brave solo entrepreneurs fighting against the world, and instead look at the broader impact of the community that surrounds and supports entrepreneurs and their startups. The challenge of building Rainforests is to facilitate the growth of those supportive networks. Without those networks, entrepreneurs tend to fail at high rates." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:85)
