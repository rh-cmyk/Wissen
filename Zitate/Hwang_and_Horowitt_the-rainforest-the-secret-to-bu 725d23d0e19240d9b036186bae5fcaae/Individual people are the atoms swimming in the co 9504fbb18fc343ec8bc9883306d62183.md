# "Individual people are the atoms swimming in the complex biological system of human society. Innovation can be sparked to life by a particular combination of people who happen to have ideas, talent, and capital in the prebiotic soup of humanity. But those elements must be mixed in just the right way for them to find and connect with one another. When viewed from high above, humans are just particles moving around and bumping into each other. Rainforests―whether in Silicon Valley or elsewhere―are environments that encourage disconnected people to self-organize into greater forms of biological life." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:39)
