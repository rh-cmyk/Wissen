# "Behavioral expert Janet Crawford puts it succinctly: "Attention has a negative bias. It is much more useful to notice the tiger lurking in a tree than the tasty fruit on its branches." 33 As a consequence, we are wired generally to avoid loss more than to seek gain. Distrust is easier than trust. Perhaps surprisingly, human behavior in the new social networks on the Web has reinforced our tendency to remain in our social ghettos, rather than empower us to move beyond them. Researcher Danah Boyd has demonstrated that young people in social networking communities like Facebook and Myspace tend to recreate online the groups they belong to offline―with the same homogenous race and class characteristics―despite their easy access to hundreds of millions of other types of people."
