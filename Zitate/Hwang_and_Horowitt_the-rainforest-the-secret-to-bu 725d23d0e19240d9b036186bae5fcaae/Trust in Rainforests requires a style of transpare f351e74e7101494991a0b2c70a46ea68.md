# "Trust in Rainforests requires a style of transparent communication which is not common in many parts of the world. Our work in places with strong family cultures, such as East Asia, Latin America, or the Middle East, has revealed a cultural tendency for people to keep their "real" opinions to themselves out of courtesy or conflict-avoidance. Passive-aggressive behavior―which causes miscommunication and misinterpretation―can easily turn into resentment in a fast-paced environment. In places like the post-Soviet countries, people often struggle to have a genuine debate without causing a nasty argument. Trust depends on social patterns that encourage openness without defensiveness, honesty without argument, and opinions without grievances." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:147)
