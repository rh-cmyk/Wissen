# "To launch a new startup company with great potential, one must assemble a whole range of objects with values that are virtually impossible to price accurately. An entrepreneur will typically start with nothing except his ability to talk. From there, he must then be able to assemble a wide network of valuable people and resources to make his company successfulâ€•ideas, expertise, market insights, investment capital, legal services, intellectual property, accounting services, banking, manufacturing capabilities, sales and marketing skills, relationships with distributors, regulatory expertise, and so on. Each of these elements is critical to the company's success. How do you organize hundreds of essential people and resources that are impossible to price accurately?" (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:100)
