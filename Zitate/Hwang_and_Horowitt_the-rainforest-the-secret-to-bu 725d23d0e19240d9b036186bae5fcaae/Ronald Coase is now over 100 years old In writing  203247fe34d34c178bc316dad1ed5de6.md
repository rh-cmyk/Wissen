# "Ronald Coase is now over 100 years old. In writing this book, we were fortunate enough to connect with him. He suggests today that the ideas he expressed in his original article were far from complete. The real world is far more complicatedâ€•one must deal with a range of complex social and psychological factors, personal networks, and information flows. He laments how few economists take these important issues seriously." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:55)
