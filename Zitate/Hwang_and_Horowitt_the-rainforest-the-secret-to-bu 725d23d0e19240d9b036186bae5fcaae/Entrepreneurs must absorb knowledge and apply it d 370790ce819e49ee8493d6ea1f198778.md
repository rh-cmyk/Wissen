# "Entrepreneurs must absorb knowledge and apply it differently than traditional business-people. They tend to be nonlinear thinkers who can integrate and synthesize large amounts of information. They are able to abstract random pieces of data and assemble it in ways that are not apparent to many others. They can fill in the gaps with educated guesses. Consequently, they are attuned to "the moment," constantly looking for ways to apply their knowledge in the present and accelerate their forward momentum." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:86)
