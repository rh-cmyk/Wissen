# "ProFusion failed because it was like a lone flower in a desert. There was no Rainforest around it. It was like an ingredient in a gourmet meal, without the rest of the gourmet meal. A great idea―the ProFusion meta-search technology―had some great technical talent behind it: the Gauches. But they did not have access to everything else needed to nurture a startup business―people who could really help them navigate the growth process, capture the loyalty of new users, develop business deals that could grow their user base, forge advertising partnerships to convert their users into revenues, hire executives who understood effective consumer marketing, and raise capital to enable them to do all these things. ProFusion was based in Lawrence, Kansas, almost a full day's journey to any of the major regional clusters for executive talent, entrepreneurial capital, and strategic partners that understood how to build freshly minted startups into world-changing companies. Susan recalls, "Working from Kansas, we were simply not close to the industry and had a hard time being taken seriously as a company. We weren't landing those contracts. We couldn't convince large companies or investors to rely on us."" (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:46)
