# "Larry describes it in simple terms: You start with a breakout field. That becomes your framework. And then you just start meeting with the world's leaders in that field. Often, these are emerging areas, so there are not a huge number of leaders in the field. I will go to one of those leaders, and I will ask them, "If I were to start a company in this field, what other five people should I involve in such a company?" And I do that successfully with every person I meet. And then pretty quickly, it always coalesces, every single time I've done it. Here are the five world leaders you need to lock up a field, and here is the compelling vision you should pursue to build that company." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:73)
