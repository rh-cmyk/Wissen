# "participating in an "innovation culture" actually requires us to overcome some of our deepest instincts as human beings. We must fight two forces opposing innovation: our biology and our brains. We fight our biology because deep emotional impulses, remnants of our primitive past, make human beings wary of one another. We fight our brains because innovative behavior is generally so risky and unrewarding that it does not make rational sense in most cases. As a result, when it comes to innovation systems, the forces that push people apart are far stronger than the forces that pull people together." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:94)
