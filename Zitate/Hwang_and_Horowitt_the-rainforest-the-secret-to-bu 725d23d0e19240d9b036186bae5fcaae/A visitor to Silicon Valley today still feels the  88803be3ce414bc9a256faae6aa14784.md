# "A visitor to Silicon Valley today still feels the legacy of the frontier culture. It is palpable. You can see the physical evidence in the rustic wooden architecture found even in modern buildings. You sense the love of open space in the rolling hills and among the trails in the redwood forests. You notice the large number of ranches and horses dotting the hills. You hear the fierce individualism in the roar of motorcycles―like modern-day horses―racing along the ridges of the mountains. You observe the variety of eclectic, individualistic hobbies that people pursue. The modern high technology industry of Silicon Valley would never have existed without the culture that developed on the American frontier, but not just because of its emphasis on individualism, as most would assume. Silicon Valley is also the heir of the frontier spirit because of its unique collectivism. As Frederick Jackson Turner observed over a century ago, it is the tension between the individual and the collective that matters. The frontier was conquered not just by individualists, but by a culture that enabled individuals to work together pragmatically on mutually beneficial projects." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:139)
