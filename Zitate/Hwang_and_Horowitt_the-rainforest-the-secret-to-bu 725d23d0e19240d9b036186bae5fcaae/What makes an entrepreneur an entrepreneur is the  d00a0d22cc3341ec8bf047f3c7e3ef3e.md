# "What makes an entrepreneur an entrepreneur is the ability to organize otherwise independent atoms, to lead people to collaborate on products or services that, in the beginning, are nothing more than mere ideas. When there are only ideas, he or she must convince people to join the effort by describing a desirable future, a story about what might be. An entrepreneur envisions how to make a new business―like a new work of art―appear from fragmented components. There is joy in the alchemy that happens when organizing these pieces." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:126)
