# "Throughout history, there have been several fundamental barriers that have kept people of diverse backgrounds from working together. 1. Geographic barriers (e.g., mountains, oceans, distance) 2. Social network failures (e.g., people belonging to different social circles) 3. Cultural and language differences (e.g., people not understanding each other) 4. Lack of trust (e.g., people fearful of working together) These fundamental barriers hinder markets from functioning efficiently. They make free markets less free. They inhibit the creation of value. […] the first one, the cost of overcoming geography, has fallen significantly and will continue to fall. […] the barriers that prevent innovators from working together are shifting from the physical to the interpersonal." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:56)
