# "The faster the velocity of nutrients within a system, the healthier the entire system. We can think of ideas, talent, and capital like particles that are limited by the speed at which they flow. If a new idea is injected somewhere in the network—say, a revolutionary method to convert waste to energy at lower cost—we want that idea to have the ability to circulate within the whole system, to get where it is needed, whether that destination ends up being an entrepreneur, a corporation which can license the technology, or a researcher who can incorporate the idea in her own work."
