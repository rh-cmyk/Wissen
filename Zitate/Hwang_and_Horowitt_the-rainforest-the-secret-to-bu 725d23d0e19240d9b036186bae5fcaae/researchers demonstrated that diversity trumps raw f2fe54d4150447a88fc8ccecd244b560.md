# "researchers demonstrated that diversity trumps raw ability for problem-solving in groups. A team of randomly selected people will outperform a team comprised of selected experts because experts can be too similar to one another and possess less diversity of ideas. The process of opening new doors and listening is the real way that entrepreneurs "learn." Businesses are not built by constructing abstract theories while sitting at a desk. They are built in a non-linear, unpredictable manner based on constant iteration and testing in the real world." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:145)
