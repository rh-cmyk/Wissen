# "Venture capital, therefore, is not about writing a bunch of small checks. Nor is it about selecting winning stocks, like a mutual fund manager or stock broker. Venture capital is about creating value where none existed before. This value is grown only after the money is investedâ€•in close collaboration with the entrepreneurs." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:206)
