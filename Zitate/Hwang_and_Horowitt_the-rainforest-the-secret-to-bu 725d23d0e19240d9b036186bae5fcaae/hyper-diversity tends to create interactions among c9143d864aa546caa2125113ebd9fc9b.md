# "hyper-diversity tends to create interactions among people with hyperspecialization, which opens the door to a universe of possible hyper-exchanges. It is no accident that places like Silicon Valley have an exceptional amount of diversity among its people, whether by race, ethnicity, birthplace, training, experience, skills, personality, or otherwise. The melting pot offers inherent, but often latent, value. By their nature, however, such ideas and skills are nearly impossible to value accurately. One key solution to this conundrum would seem to be the creation of trust. Trust, after all, is how people since the dawn of human history have bridged gaps when monetary currency was not enough to consummate a transaction. As a practical solution, however, trust is not so trustworthy." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:103)
