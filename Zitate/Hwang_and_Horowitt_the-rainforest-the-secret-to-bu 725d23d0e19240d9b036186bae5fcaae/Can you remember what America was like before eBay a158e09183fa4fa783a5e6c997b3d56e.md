# "Can you remember what America was like before eBay? There were millions of people who owned stuff they did not want, and there were millions of people who wanted that stuff. But they could not find each other. There used to be a lot more garage sales back then. […] Now, instead of the physical products exchanged on eBay, imagine a system for the exchange of invisible non-physical resources―ideas, talent, and capital. Then imagine all of the potential" (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:63)
