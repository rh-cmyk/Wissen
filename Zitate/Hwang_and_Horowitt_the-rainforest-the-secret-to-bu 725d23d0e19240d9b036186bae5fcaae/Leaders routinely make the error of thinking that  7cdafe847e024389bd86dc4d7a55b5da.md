# "Leaders routinely make the error of thinking that drawing lines between organizational boxes is the same as actually connecting real people between the organizations. They fail to look through the macro "paper" structures to see the micro individuals within. After all, it is the individuals―not the leaders―who will actually do the work and deal with the real challenges. Real-life linkages are human-to-human, not group-to-group."
