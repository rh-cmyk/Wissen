# "Governments and corporations by the thousands have crammed smart people into incubators, innovation centers, or other similar structures, only to find that little of value has emerged and that vast amounts of capital have been wasted. People can be sitting in the same office and still have a vast gulf between them. In virtually all attempts to create artificial Rainforests, the invisible bonds tend to break, the rubber bands snap, and the atoms are left floating on their own." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:112)
