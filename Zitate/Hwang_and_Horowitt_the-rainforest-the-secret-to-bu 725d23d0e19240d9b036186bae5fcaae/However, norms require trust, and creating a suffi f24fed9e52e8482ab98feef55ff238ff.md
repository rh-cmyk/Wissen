# "However, norms require trust, and creating a sufficient level of trust for norms to develop and remain in place is not easy. Norms usually come from shared values or lengthy relationships, not from top-down, authoritarian mandates. Humans create norms from the bottom up to streamline economic activity by reducing its transaction costs. It is self-interested behavior over the long term. Social scientists have found significant evidence that communities, over time, naturally develop norms through repeated interactions of people in a social network." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:136)
