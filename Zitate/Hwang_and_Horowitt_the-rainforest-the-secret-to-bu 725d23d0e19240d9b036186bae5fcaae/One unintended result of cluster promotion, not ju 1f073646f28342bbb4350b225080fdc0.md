# "One unintended result of cluster promotion, not just in Kansas but all over the world, is that startup companies are sometimes more likely to fail. Many companies are pushed by regional government funding to look inward geographically, when in fact they need to do the opposite to succeed […] A recent exhaustive study in Europe declared that local and national clusters were "irrelevant for innovation." […] Because regional clusters like Silicon Valley are easy to see, and have been associated with an area where entrepreneurial success has occurred, many people came to believe that clusters were essential to or even caused innovation to occur."
