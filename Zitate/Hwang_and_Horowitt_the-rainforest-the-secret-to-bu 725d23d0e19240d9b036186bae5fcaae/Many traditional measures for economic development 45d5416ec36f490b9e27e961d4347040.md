# "Many traditional measures for economic development tend to focus on static aspects―like measuring someone's temperature or weight. They are snapshots in time. What is more important is to measure the dynamism of the system over time―like measuring someone's pulse. The flow-form model gives us a tool to take the "heartbeat" of innovation, rather than its "temperature."" (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:238)
