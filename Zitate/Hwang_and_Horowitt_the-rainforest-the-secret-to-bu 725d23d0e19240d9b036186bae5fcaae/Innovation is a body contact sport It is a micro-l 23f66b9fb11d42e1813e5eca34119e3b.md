# "Innovation is a "body contact sport." It is a micro-level phenomenon. […] Free markets do not operate in a vacuum, or in a perfect laboratory environment. They are populated by human beings who are messy and chaotic and, when they interact, create situations that are full of friction and impediments to cooperation. People do not always do the right thing or act in their own self-interest. Often, it is because they do not understand or are not even aware of the right thing. Sometimes it is because of emotional or psychological characteristics that do not easily fit in a neoclassical economist's orderly view of human nature. […] When it comes to innovation, the messiness, chaos, and human friction of the real world is enough to kill most opportunities before they get a shot at the marketplace."
