# "Alternatively, entrepreneurs who choose not to register as a company are treated, by default, as either sole proprietors (with personal liability) or partners (with joint and several liability, which means that the actions of one person can create full liability for the others). A provisional corporation could allow startup founders to begin work together—allowing them to apply for grants, license intellectual property from universities, pitch for investors, etc.—without risking liability. Their provisional status would have to be disclosed to all counterparties, and they could be given a specified timeframe in which to convert their provisional status to full status."
