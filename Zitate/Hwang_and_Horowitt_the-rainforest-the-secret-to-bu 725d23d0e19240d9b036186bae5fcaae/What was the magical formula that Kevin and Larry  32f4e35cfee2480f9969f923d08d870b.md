# "What was the magical formula that Kevin and Larry had discovered? This formula, shockingly simple, was a radical departure from the way innovation is still done today in most of the business world. The textbook process of innovation is one that follows a linear progression, starting with basic science, to proof-of-concept, and then to market feasibility testingâ€•all before one ever considers hiring a team, raising money, and building a company. Kevin Kinsella's process was entirely backwards, if one believed in the conventional rules. From observing Kevin, Larry observed how the firm "spent all the seed money pulling a team together rather than doing product proof-of-concept. They saw that as the fastest value creator.""
