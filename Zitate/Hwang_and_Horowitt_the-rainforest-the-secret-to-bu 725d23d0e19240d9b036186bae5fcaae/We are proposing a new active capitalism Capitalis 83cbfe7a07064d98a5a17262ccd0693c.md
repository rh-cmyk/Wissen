# "We are proposing a new active capitalism. Capitalism is not about simply reciting the mantra of "less government." Capitalism is about decentralizing decision-making and empowering individuals to connect, collaborate, experiment, and create commercial value on their own. Congress did exactly this when it funded the First Transcontinental Railroad about 150 years ago. It is perfectly consistent with capitalism that we invest in bridging divides between people to lower their transaction costs for doing business with one another. The Rainforest is not mere business theory. It provides a new paradigm for policies and strategies that transcend the left and right divides of the political spectrum." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:257)
