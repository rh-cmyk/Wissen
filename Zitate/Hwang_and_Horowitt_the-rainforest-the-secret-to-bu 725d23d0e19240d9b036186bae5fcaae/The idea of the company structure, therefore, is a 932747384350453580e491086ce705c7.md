# "The idea of the company structure, therefore, is a critical artifice in the entrepreneurial innovation process because it replicates the role of currency in the world of goods and services, but it does so for the world of ideas and innovations. Equity (or stock) in an emerging company is the "trust inscribed" of the Rainforest. It is the currency of innovation, whether in the form of common stock, options, warrants, or preferred stock." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:101)
