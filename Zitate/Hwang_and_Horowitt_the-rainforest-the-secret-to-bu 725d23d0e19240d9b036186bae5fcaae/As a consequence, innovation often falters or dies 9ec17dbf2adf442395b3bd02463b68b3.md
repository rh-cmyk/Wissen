# "As a consequence, innovation often falters or dies. Where the accurate pricing of intangible elements like knowledge and expertise are impossible to ascertain, or where people have invested entire careers into developing specialized ideas or skills, the economic exchange often never happens. And that is what stops much innovation dead in its tracks." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:102)
