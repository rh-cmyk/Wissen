# "The Rainforest is in many ways a massively expanded version of a challenge grant. There is an implied understanding that its inhabitants are part of a voluntary, extended community participating in a great, never-ending human contest for building better things, changing lives, making friendships, contributing to something bigger than themselves, discovering the unexpected, experiencing both the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, and perhaps even making a lot of money. If you actually ask most people in the startup communities in Silicon Valley or similar places why they do what they do, you almost always find extra-rational motivations driving their behavior."
