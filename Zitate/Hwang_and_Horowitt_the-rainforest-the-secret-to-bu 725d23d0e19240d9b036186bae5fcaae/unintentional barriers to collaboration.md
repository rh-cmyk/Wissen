"An inventor who has created world-leading software or therapeutics may be free to do whatever he or she wants with it, but it is rare that they can find the right people with whom to work. Even if we get the intentional man-made barriers out of the way―government restrictions, corruption, poor law enforcement, inconsistent taxes, etc.―many unintentional barriers still remain." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:50)
