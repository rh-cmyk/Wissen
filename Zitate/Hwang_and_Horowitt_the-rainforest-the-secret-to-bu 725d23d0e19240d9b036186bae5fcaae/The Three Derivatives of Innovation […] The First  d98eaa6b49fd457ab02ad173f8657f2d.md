# "The Three Derivatives of Innovation [â€¦] The First Derivative is based on helping one innovator at a time in a linear process. Like a manufacturing assembly line, it is based on one-to-one relationships that do not scale easily. The Second Derivative is based on organizing groups of people to help one innovator at a time. It is based on a many-to-one relationship model, so it is more scalable. Programs like Larta Institute, CONNECT, and Endeavor are good examples. Their method is to construct a localized Rainforest of mentors and advisors around each startup. This method of assistance is still labor-intensive, but it is much more efficient than the heavy lifting of the First Derivative. Furthermore, the team approach means that a wider array of skills is accessible to each startup, and the building of small networks aids the creation of trust within those networks. However, it still takes significant effort to organize the right people, mobilize the right resources, and maintain the right funding that supports such initiatives every year. When the subsidies stop, the programs usually stop. Constructing lots of miniature "nature preserves" by hand is still hard work. The Third Derivative is the transformation of human culture. If people in a community are able to learn behavioral patterns that reduce the cost of transactions between them, the system can become self-sustaining." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:138)
