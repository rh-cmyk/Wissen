# "It is commonly regarded as the land of pioneers, nonconformists, artists, and rebels. It is the land of the free-spirit surfer and the iconoclastic biker. It is identified with both Ronald Reagan, who became a symbol for personal freedom and responsibility, and James Dean, who in movies like Rebel Without a Cause represented rebellion for the sake of rebellion. It is where Steve Jobs urged us to "think different." It is where iconoclastic sports like skateboarding were born." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:113)
