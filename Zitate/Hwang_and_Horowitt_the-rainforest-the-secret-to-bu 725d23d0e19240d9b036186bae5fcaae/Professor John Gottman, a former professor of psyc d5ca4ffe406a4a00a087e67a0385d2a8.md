# "Professor John Gottman, a former professor of psychology at the University of Washington, developed a method of predicting whether married couples would divorce over time. In a 14-year study, his model accurately predicted divorce 93% of the time by observing couples' behavior for merely fifteen minutes. 5 Another study detected patterns that could predict divorce of newlyweds based on just three minutes of observation. Stanford doctoral researcher Malte Jung [â€¦] has been applying the same techniques used by Professor Gottman to predict whether teams of innovators will succeed or fail." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:95)
