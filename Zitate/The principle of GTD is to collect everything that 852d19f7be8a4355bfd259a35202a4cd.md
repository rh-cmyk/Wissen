#quote  "The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. […] Unfortunately, David Allen's technique cannot simply be transferred to the task of insightful writing. The first reason is that GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition. We usually start with rather vague ideas that are bound to change until they become clearer in the course of our research […] The other reason is that GTD requires projects to be broken down into smaller, concrete "next steps.""
