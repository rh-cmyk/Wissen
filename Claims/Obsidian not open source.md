"We'll likely make a formal guarantee to open source in the case of us shutting down." ([[Xu 2020]]:25)

## pro

"Extending a piece of software requires generally extensive familiarization with the codebase, possibly ranging into millions of lines. On the other hand, a well documented plugin or scripting system, which sits on top of the existing domain logic and is well documented and full of examples, generally is an excellent way to allow extending the base app. The base app can be open or closed source. Without scripting or plugin system it's still a black box for most intents (as the time needed to study and change it would likely be too much). […] the question was "is an open source software more extensible...". And for most situations where software is used the answer is no. […] the best way to make software (openor closed-source) extensible is via a plugin API. without it, the only way for end users to extend open-source software is to fork and maintain the fork forever, or attempt to merge upstream. so one might argue that the quality of the plugin API (and its documentation) is the primary measure of a software's "extensibility"." ([[Xu 2020]]:5)

## contra

"I will never again build any kind of workflow for my knowledge on top of anything that isn't open source. […] The peace of mind I get knowing that all of my data is under my control is worth it, after scrambling to archive content from failed or pivoting services, removing my data from businesses that try to exploit it or trying to migrate my data from one old app to a different newer app." ([[Xu 2020]]:25)

""Open source" is both a license and a development model. You're talking about a license, but someone interested in workflow longevity will probably not be satisfied with a source dump from a dead company. They're looking for a community which knows how to maintain it. As JWZ once said: "You can't take a dying project, sprinkle it with the magic pixie dust of 'open source,' and have everything magically work out."" ([[Xu 2020]]:26)
