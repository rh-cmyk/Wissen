## Nachteile
- Nesting
	- Only pages can be nested, not cards. Each card is a page, but if viewed as a page properties are not shown
- Easily link cards 
	- linking only through property "relation" or by nesting pages
	- no link that is neither parent nor child ("partner")
	- no drag-and-drop linking
	- no linking multiple pages at once
