# Foam: VS-Code extension

integrates bidirectional links in VS Code (markdown editor), which is natively linked with git

integrates obsidian-like graph preview

VS Code offers powerful, but geeky UI

Usage example:

Quotes of a new source added to folder

opened via add-on "Open Multiple Files"

opens all quotes as tabs

click on first quote in open editors

navigate to next quote with cmd-alt-right

if quote interesting move to new editor with ctrl-cmd-right

default: opens editor to right, better for text: open below

settings have to be changed: opentoside:down
