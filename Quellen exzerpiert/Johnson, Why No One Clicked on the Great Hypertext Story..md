# Johnson, Steven. „Why No One Clicked on the Great Hypertext Story“. Wired, 16. April 2013. https://www.wired.com/2013/04/hypertext/. 

"many of us thought the primary impact of hypertext would be on storytelling. At Feed, we originally imagined that contributors would compose stories built out of small blocks of text—roughly the length of a blog post—that readers would navigate according to their own whims. [...] People would explore the story, not read it." (Johnson 2013:1)

"It's not that hypertext went on to become less interesting than its literary advocates imagined in those early days. Rather, a whole different set of new forms arose in its place. [...] Readers did end up exploring an idea or news event by following links between small blocks of text; it's just that the blocks of text turned out to be written by different authors, publishing on different sites. [...] Each landing point along that itinerary is a linear piece, designed to be read from start to finish. But the constellation they form is something else. Hypertext turned out to be a brilliant medium for bundling a collection of linear stories or arguments written by different people." (Johnson 2013:1)

"It turned out that nonlinear reading spaces had a problem: They were incredibly difficult to write. When you tried to make an argument or tell a journalistic story in which any individual section could be a starting or ending point, it wound up creating a whole host of technical problems, the main one being that you had to reintroduce characters or concepts in every section. [...] We annotated important documents or passages from new books, and we held multithreaded hypertext debates. But we never managed to publish a true branching-path narrative." (Johnson 2013:2)
