"The importance of nomenclature, notation, and language as tools of thought has long been recognized. In chemistry and in botany, for example, the establishment of systems of nomenclature by Lavoisier and Linnaeus did much to stimulate and to channel later investigation. Concerning language, George Boole in his Laws of Thought [1, p. 24] asserted "That language is an instrument of human reason, and not merely a medium for the expression of thought, is a truth generally admitted." Mathematical notation provides perhaps the best-known and best-developed example of language used consciously as a tool of thought." ([Iverson 1979:53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=2))

> "By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect increases the mental power of the race". (A. N. Whitehead) "The quantity of meaning compressed into small space by algebraic signs, is another circumstance that facilitates the reasonings we are accustomed to carry on by their aid." (Charles Babbage)

"Nevertheless, mathematical notation has serious deficiencies. In particular, it lacks universality, and must be interpreted differently according to the topic, according to the author, and even according to the immediate context. Programming languages, because they were designed for the purpose of directing computers, offer important advantages as tools of thought. Not only are they universal (general-purpose), but they are also executable and unambiguous. Executability makes it possible to use computers to perform extensive experiments on ideas expressed in a programming language, and the lack of ambiguity makes possible precise thought experiments. In other respects, however, most programming languages are decidedly inferior to mathematical notation and are little used as tools of thought in ways that would be considered significant by, say, an applied mathematician. The thesis of the present paper is that the advantages of executability and universality found in programming languages can be effectively combined, in a single coherent language, with the advantages offered by mathematical notation." ([Iverson 1979:53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=2))

"The executable language to be used is APL, a general-purpose language which originated in an attempt to provide clear and precise expression in writing and teaching, and which was implemented as a programming language only after several years of use and development [...]. I have chosen not to provide a separate introduction to it, but rather to introduce it in context as needed. Mathematical notation is always introduced in this way rather than being taught, as programming languages commonly are, in a separate course. Notation suited as a tool of thought in any topic should permit easy introduction in the context of that topic." ([Iverson 1979:54](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=3))

"If it is to be effective as a tool of thought, a notation must allow convenient expression not only of notions arising directly from a problem but also of those arising in subsequent analysis, generalization, and specialization." ([Iverson 1979:55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=4))

"Part of the suggestive power of a language resides in the ability to represent identities in brief, general, and easily remembered forms" ([Iverson 1979:58](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=7))

"brevity facilitates reasoning. Brevity is achieved by subordinating detail, and we will here consider three important ways of doing this: the use of arrays, the assignment of names to functions and variables, and the use of operators." ([Iverson 1979:59](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=8))

"The utility of a language as a tool of thought increases with the range of topics it can treat, but decreases with the amount of vocabulary and the complexity of grammatical rules which the user must keep in mind. Economy of notation is therefore important.
Economy requires that a large number of ideas be expressible in terms of a relatively small vocabulary. A fundamental scheme for achieving this is the introduction of grammatical rules by which meaningful phrases and sentences can be constructed by combining elements of the vocabulary." ([Iverson 1979:62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=11))

"A significant economy of symbols, as opposed to economy of functions, is attained by allowing any symbol to represent both a monadic function (i.e., a function of one argument) and a dyadic function, in the same manner that the minus sign is commonly used for both subtraction and negation." ([Iverson 1979:63](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=12))

"The subjects of mathematical analysis and computation can be represented in a variety of ways, and each representation may possess particular advantages." ([Iverson 1979:71](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=20))

"In order to use different representations conveniently, it is important to be able to express the transformations between representations clearly and precisely. Conventional mathematical notation is often deficient in this respect [...]. systems, polynominals, permutations, graphs, and boolean algebra." ([Iverson 1979:72](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=21))

"APL is similar to conventional mathematical notation in many important respects: in the use of functions with explicit arguments and explicit results, in the concomitant use of composite expressions which apply functions to the results of other functions, in the provision of graphic symbols for the more commonly used functions, in the use of vectors, matrices, and higher-rank arrays, and in the use of operators which, like the derivative and the convolution operators of mathematics, apply to functions to produce functions. In the treatment of functions APL differs in providing a precise formal mechanism for the definition of new functions." ([Iverson 1979:91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=40))

"In the interpretation of composite expressions APL agrees in the use of parentheses, but differs in eschewing hierarchy so as to treat all functions (user-defined as well as primitive) alike, and in adopting a single rule for the application of both monadic and dyadic functions: the right argument of a function is the value of the entire expression to its right. An important consequence of this rule is that any portion of an expression which is free of parentheses may be read analytically from left to right (since the leading function at any stage is the "outer" or overall function to be applied to the result on its right), and constructively from right to left (since the rule is easily seen to be equivalent to the rule that execution is carried out from right to left)." ([Iverson 1979:92](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=41))

"Such treatments of a number of topics in APL are available, including: high school algebra, elementary analysis, calculus, design of digital systems, resistive circuits, and crystallography. All of these provide indications of the ease of introducing the notation needed, and one provides comments on experience in its use. Professor Blaauw, in discussing the design of digital systems, says that "APL makes it possible to describe what really occurs in a complex system," that "APL is particularly suited to this purpose, since it allows expression at the high architectural level, at the lowest implementation level, and at all levels between," and that "...learning the language pays of (sic) in- and outside the field of computer design."
Users of computers and programming languages are often concerned primarily with the efficiency of execution of algorithms, and might, therefore, summarily dismiss many of the algorithms presented here. Such dismissal would be short-sighted, since a clear statement of an algorithm can usually be used as a basis from which one may easily derive more efficient algorithms." ([Iverson 1979:96](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6RJ43G5Q?page=45))

"The practice of first developing a clear and precise definition of a process without regard to efficiency, and then using it as a guide and a test in exploring equivalent processes possessing other characteristics, such as greater efficiency, is very common in mathematics. It is a very fruitful practice which should not be blighted by premature emphasis on efficiency in computer execution. Measures of efficiency are often unrealistic because they concern counts of "substantive" functions such as multiplication and addition, and ignore the housekeeping (indexing and other selection processes} which is often greatly increased by less straightforward algorithms. [...] overemphasis of efficiency leads to an unfortunate circularity in design: for reasons of efficiency early programming languages reflected the characteristics of the early computers, and each generation of computers reflects the needs of the programming languages of the preceding generation."
