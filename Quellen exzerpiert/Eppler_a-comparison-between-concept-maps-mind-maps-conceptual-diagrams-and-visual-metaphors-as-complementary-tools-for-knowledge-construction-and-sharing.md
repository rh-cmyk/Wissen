"Concept maps have demonstrated their positive effects on student learning for various topics and in various teaching situations.3 Concept maps (for a definition see Table 1 ) are, however, not without drawbacks 15-17 and they may not fit all types of target groups (such as non-academics), learning tasks (i.e. developing procedural skills), application situations (such as rapid note taking) or topics (such as processes or developments over time)." ([Eppler 2006:203](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=2))

"In addition, the general top-down (from concepts to examples) structure of concept maps may not be adequate to represent or structure sequential content such as processes, timelines, or developments. The boxes and arrows format may also make it difficult to efficiently represent a great number of related items in an accessible format." ([Eppler 2006:203](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=2))

"There is a myriad of node-link mapping methods from such diverse areas as psychology, computer science, requirements engineering, or business administration. Examples of such systematic methods that employ geometric figures for items, activities or concepts, and arrows for relationships are: cognitive mapping, mind mapping, entity-relationship models, flow charts, Toulmin maps, IBIS argumentation maps, semantic networks, swim lane diagrams, clustering, UML diagrams, system dynamics, evocative knowledge maps, soft system modelling, or process event chains" ([Eppler 2006:205](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=4))

"Nevertheless, there are also mapping methods that do not make use of the node-link paradigm. Examples of such mapping methods are: Venn and Euler diagrams, Robert Horn's infomulas, radar charts, Zwicky's morphological boxes, Vee diagrams, knowledge cartographies, tree maps, 3D-cubes, S-curves, impact wheels, or graphic facilitation.32,33 Rather than highlighting indi- vidual items and their relationships, these visualization methods focus on 'the big picture', that is, on an overall structure to map or position information meaningfully. In these methods, the overall graphic structure is usually provided by a conceptual diagram, a visual metaphor or a mix of the two." ([Eppler 2006:205](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=4))

"For this comparison, we have chosen one widely used method, mind mapping,6 and two less prominent approaches, conceptual diagrams and visual or graphic metaphors." ([Eppler 2006:205](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=4))

"Visual metaphors 21,27 are graphic structures that use the shape and elements of a familiar natural or manmade artefact or of an easily recognizable activity or story in order to use the typical associations to convey additional meaning about the content. Examples of such visual metaphors are tree depictions of science domains (as in Diderot and D'Alembert's famous Encyclopaedia), iceberg depictions of explicit and implicit knowledge, the visualization of a selection process by employing a funnel picture, or the visualization of an IT architecture as a temple structure with four pillars." ([Eppler 2006:205](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=4))

"A conceptual diagram 28 employs a graphic conceptual framework to visually structure information or learning content with the help of pre-defined categories. The categories are usually derived from a (domain-specific) theory or model. Examples of such conceptual diagrams are Aristotle's square of oppositions (visualized first by Boethius), Stephen Toulmin's argumentation diagram,7 Michael Porter's five forces diagram,8 Ishikawa's 5M diagram,22 or Kaplan and Norton's strategy map.9 All of these concep- tual diagrams structure information visually with the help of pre-defined (often theory-derived) graphic 'containers'." ([Eppler 2006:205](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=4))

"Visual metaphors can be powerful catalysts for knowledge transfer and" ([Eppler 2006:205](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=4))

"learning as they support learners in connecting what they already know (the properties of the metaphor domain) with new material (the domain unto which the metaphor is being applied)." ([Eppler 2006:206](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=5))

". Lakoff and Johnson 13,14 have demonstrated that metaphors are at the core of our cognitive abilities and can thus be used explicitly as cognitive tools in learning. This is especially true when the power of a metaphor is combined with the appeal and directness of visualization.21 Nevertheless, visual metaphors also have a number of potential disadvantages.23 Visual metaphors can divert attention from their content,24 they can be unfitting for certain contexts (they can be seen as too playful), they can be manipulative and difficult to let go of or switch,25 they can loose their benefit once they have been (over) used, and they may overemphasize commonalities among things that are essentially different.26" ([Eppler 2006:206](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=5))

"Conceptual diagrams can be used to develop concepts in class, while visual metaphors are a good way of summarizing them at the end of the class jointly with a greater level of detail." ([Eppler 2006:206](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=5))

"A first glance at the key features of the four visualization methods reveals that their profiles are quite distinct: whereas concept maps and mind maps are great personal learning tools that result in individual solutions, conceptual diagrams and visual metaphors are tools for knowledge communication and joint knowledge construction. While mind maps and visual metaphors result in attractive, colourful and memorable results, conceptual diagrams and concept maps tend to be less memorable, because most of them look very much alike - a collection of boxes and arrows (with occasional icons)." ([Eppler 2006:206](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=5))

"Whereas Novak's concept maps mainly serve the purpose of student learning by having them list and connect various concepts through explicit labels, the main function of a concept skeleton is one of summarization and elicitation, and these tasks only regarding one single concept at a time: concept skeletons of this type thus help to transform sketchy ideas into systematic thoughts." ([Eppler 2006:207](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=6))

"As mentioned in the previous section, a complementary way to use the four visualization methods uses conceptual diagrams for in-class concept development, handwritten mind-mapping for in-class note taking, concept mapping for personal student reviewing at home, and visual metaphors for joint in-class summaries. This didactic logic is consistent with the relative advantages and disadvantages discussed in Table 2. Table 3 shows this didactic approach which uses the four methods in a complementary way and describes their application." ([Eppler 2006:207](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=6))

"First, a special type of conceptual diagram has been used to structure complex content during class presentations (see Figure 1) and lectures. At the beginning of the session, the diagram contained only the concept label, all other boxes were interactively filled in with occasional contributions from the students who had heard about the concept previously." ([Eppler 2006:207](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=6))

"visual metaphor shows the status of the discussion after a 40-min debate." ([Eppler 2006:210](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=9))

"In follow-up lessons, the discussed concepts seemed to be remembered better than usual" ([Eppler 2006:210](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=9))

"The results of these interviews showed that the students require a lot of time, systematic assistance and feedback in order to devise highquality concept maps. They revealed that some students had problems understanding the concept maps of others." ([Eppler 2006:210](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=9))

"A different future research route is to develop mixedmode visualizations that combine the strong points of the four methods, as for examples the straight forward rules of concept maps, the clarity of conceptual diagrams, the simplicity of mind maps, and the memorable richness of visual metaphors" ([Eppler 2006:211](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2533259/items/D292XI62?page=10))
