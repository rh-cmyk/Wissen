"relying on tagging is too fragile and requires too much maintenance, spreading attention too uniformly across all notes whether or not they are truly valuable. The virtual matrix sounds cool and futuristic, but our minds are not made to work well with such abstract concepts — we understand placing one thing in one place intuitively and automatically." ([Forte 2017:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DHH2FKWF?page=3))

"I propose we make the design of individual notes the primary factor, instead of tags or notebooks." ([Forte 2017:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DHH2FKWF?page=4))

"Making a note discoverable involves making it small, simple, and easy to digest. We accomplish this using compression: creating highly condensed summaries [...]. But we also want to make our notes understandable. This involves including all the context [...]. This is a difficult tradeoff because you cannot compress something without losing some of its context." ([Forte 2017:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DHH2FKWF?page=5))

"Progressive Summarization [...] is a method for opportunistic compression — summarizing and condensing a piece of information in small spurts, spread across time, in the course of other work, and only doing as much or as little as the information deserves. [...] You have to summarize the note without knowing what it will be used for." ([Forte 2017:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DHH2FKWF?page=6))

"Progressive Summarization works in "layers" of summarization. Layer 0 is the original, full-length source text. Layer 1 is the content that I initially bring into my note-taking program. I don't have an explicit set of criteria on what to keep. I just capture anything that feels insightful, interesting, or useful." ([Forte 2017:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DHH2FKWF?page=6))

"Layer 2 is the first round of true summarization, in which I bold only the best parts of the passages I've imported. Again, I have no explicit criteria. I look for keywords, key phrases, and key sentences that I feel represent the core or essence of the idea being discussed. I do this bolding layer at a later time, when I'm already reviewing this note anyway.

[...] For Layer 3, I switch to highlighting, so I can make out the smaller number of highlighted passages among all the bolded ones. This time, I'm looking for the "best of the best," only highlighting something if it is truly unique or valuable. And again, I'm only adding this third layer when I'm already reviewing the note anyway. For Layer 4, I'm still summarizing, but going beyond highlighting the words of others, to recording my own. For a small number of notes that are the most insightful, I summarize layers 2 and 3 in an informal executive summary at the top of the note, restating the key points in my own words." ([Forte 2017:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DHH2FKWF?page=7))

"And finally, for a tiny minority of sources, the ones that are so powerful and exciting I want them to become part of how I think and work immediately, I remix them. After pulling them apart and dissecting them from every angle in layers 1-4, I add my own personality and creativity and turn them into something else."
