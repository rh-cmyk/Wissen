"Amish communities were the closest thing I could find on this continent to the state of minimal technology I had experienced in Asia. I admired the Amish for their selective possessions. Their unadorned homes were square bundles of contentment." ([Kelly 2014:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=8))

"The technology of TV had a remarkable ability to beckon people at specific times and then hold them enthralled for hours. Its creative commercials told them to acquire more technologies. They obeyed. I noticed that other bossy technologies, such as the car, also seemed to be able to get people to serve them, and to prod them to acquire and use still more technologies (freeways, drive-in theaters, fast food). I decided to keep technology to a minimum in my own life." ([Kelly 2014:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=8))

"If my travels in the old world had taught me anything, it was that aspirin, cotton clothing, metal pots, and telephones are fantastic inventions. They are good. People everywhere in the world, with very few exceptions, grab them when they can. Anyone who has ever held a perfectly designed hand tool knows that it can lift your soul. Airplanes had stretched my horizons; books had opened my mind; antibiotics had saved my life; photography had ignited my muse. Even the chain saw, which can cleanly slice through knotty burls too tough for a hand ax, had instilled in me a reverence for the beauty and strength of wood no other agent in the world could." ([Kelly 2014:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=8))

"To my immense surprise, I found that these high-tech computer networks were not deadening the souls of early users like me; they were filling our souls. There was something unexpectedly organic about these ecosystems of people and wires. Out of complete nothingness, we were barn-raising a virtual commonwealth. When the internet finally came along a few years later, it seemed almost Amish to me." ([Kelly 2014:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=9))

"At the very cultural moment when pundits declared that writing was dead, millions began writing online more than they ever had written before. Exactly when the experts declared people would only bowl alone, millions began to gather together in large numbers. Online they collaborated, cooperated, shared, and created in myriad unexpected ways." ([Kelly 2014:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=9))

"I don't have a PDA, a smartphone, or Bluetooth anything. I don't twitter. My three kids grew up without TV, and we still don't have broadcast or cable in our home. I don't have a laptop or travel with a computer, and I am often the last in my circle to get the latest must-have gadget. I ride my bike more often than I drive these days. I see my friends leashed to their vibrating handhelds, but I continue to keep the cornucopia of technology at arm's length so that I can more easily remember who I am. At the same time, I run a popular daily website called Cool Tools, which is a continuation of my long-ago Whole Earth job evaluating select technology for the empowerment of individuals. A river of artifacts flows through my studio sent by vendors hoping for an endorsement; a fair number of those artifacts never leave. I am surrounded by stuff. Despite my wariness, I have chosen to deliberately position myself to keep the maximum number of technological options within my reach. I acknowledge that my relationship with technology is full of contradictions" ([Kelly 2014:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=9))

"When the ancient Greeks used the word techne, it meant something like art, skill, craft, or even craftiness. Ingenuity may be the closest translation. Techne was used to indicate the ability to outwit circumstances, and as such it was a trait greatly treasured by poets like Homer. King Odysseus was a master of techne. Plato, though, like most scholarly gentlemen of that era, thought that techne, which he used to mean manual craftwork, was base, impure, and degraded. Because of his contempt for practical knowledge, Plato omitted any references to craft in his elaborate classification of all knowledge. In fact, there's not a single treatise in the Greek corpus that even mentions technelogos—with one exception. To the best of our knowledge, it was in Aristotle's treatise Rhetoric that the word techne was first joined to logos (meaning word or speech or literacy) to yield the single term technelogos. Four times in this essay, Aristotle refers to technelogos, but in all four instances, his exact meaning is unclear. Is he concerned with the "skill of words" or the "speech about art" or maybe a literacy of craft? After this fleeting, cryptic appearance, the term technology essentially disappeared. But of course, technology did not. The Greeks invented iron welding, the bellows, the lathe, and the key. Their students the Romans invented the vault, the aqueduct, blown glass, cement, sewers, and water mills. Yet in their own time and for many centuries thereafter, the totality of all that was manufactured was virtually invisible—never discussed as a distinct subject, apparently never even contemplated. Technology could be found everywhere in the ancient world except in the minds of humans. In the centuries following, scholars continued to call the making of things craft and the expression of inventiveness art. As tools, machines, and contraptions spread, the work performed with them was termed the "useful arts." Each useful art—mining, weaving, metalworking, needlework—had its own secret knowledge that was passed on through a master/apprentice relationship. But it was still an art, a singular extension of its maker, and the term retained the original Greek sense of craft and cleverness. For the next thousand years, art and technique were perceived as distinctly personal realms. Each product of these arts, whether an iron-work fence or an herbal formula, was considered a unique expression derived from the particular cleverness of a particular person. Anything made was a work of solitary genius. As the historian Carl Mitcham explains, "Mass production was unthinkable to the classical mind, and not just for technical reasons."" ([Kelly 2014:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=10))

"Finally, in 1802, Johann Beckmann, an economics professor at Gottingen University in Germany, gave this ascending force its name. Beckmann argued that the rapid spread and increasing importance of the useful arts demanded that we teach them in a "systemic order." He addressed the techne of architecture, the techne of chemistry, metalwork, masonry, and manufacturing, and for the first time he claimed these spheres of knowledge were interconnected. He synthesized them into a unified curriculum and wrote a textbook titled Guide to Technology (or Technologie in German)," ([Kelly 2014:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=10))

"Large systems of technology often behave like a very primitive organism. Networks, especially electronic networks, exhibit near-biological behavior." ([Kelly 2014:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=11))

"If DNA could be made into a working computer, and a working computer could be made to evolve like DNA, then there might be, or must be, a certain equivalency between the made and the born. Technology and life must share some fundamental essence." ([Kelly 2014:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=11))

"Both life and technology seem to be based on immaterial flows of information. It was at this" ([Kelly 2014:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=11))

"If a thousand lines of letters in UNIX qualifies as a technology (the computer code for a web page), then a thousand lines of letters in English ( Hamlet) must qualify as well. They both can change our behavior, alter the course of events, or enable future inventions." ([Kelly 2014:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=12))

"We can't separate out the multiple overlapping technologies responsible for a Lord of the Rings movie. The literary rendering of the original novel is as much an invention as the digital rendering of its fantastical creatures. Both are useful works of the human imagination. Both influence audiences powerfully. Both are technological. Why not just call this vast accumulation of invention and creation culture?" ([Kelly 2014:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=12))

"But the term culture falls short in one critical way. It is too small. What Beckmann recognized in 1802 when he baptized technology was that the things we were inventing were spawning other inventions in a type of selfgeneration. Technical arts enabled new tools, which launched new arts, which birthed new tools, ad infinitum. Artifacts were becoming so complex in their operation and so interconnected in their origins that they formed a new whole: technology. The term culture fails to convey this essential self-propelling momentum pushing technology. But to be honest, the term technology does not quite get it right, either. It, too, is too small, because technology can also mean specific methods and gear, as in "biotechnology," or "digital technology," or the technology of the Stone Age." ([Kelly 2014:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=12))

"I've somewhat reluctantly coined a word to designate the greater, global, massively interconnected system of technology vibrating around us. I call it the technium. The technium extends beyond shiny hardware to include culture, art, social institutions, and intellectual creations of all types. It includes intangibles like software, law, and philosophical concepts. And most important, it includes the generative impulses of our inventions to encourage more tool making, more technology invention, and more self-enhancing connections." ([Kelly 2014:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=12))

"As a word, technium is akin to the German word technik, which similarly encapsulates the grand totality of machines, methods, and engineering processes. Technium is also related to the French noun technique, used by French philosophers to mean the society and culture of tools. But neither term captures what I consider to be the essential quality of the technium: this idea of a self-reinforcing system of creation. At some point in its evolution, our system of tools and machines and ideas became so dense in feedback loops and complex interactions that it spawned a bit of independence. It began to exercise some autonomy." ([Kelly 2014:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=12))

"after 10,000 years of slow evolution and 200 years of incredible intricate exfoliation, the technium is maturing into its own thing. Its sustaining network of self-reinforcing processes and parts have given it a noticeable measure of autonomy. It may have once been as simple as an old computer program, merely parroting what we told it, but now it is more like a very complex organism that often follows its own urges." ([Kelly 2014:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=12))

"Life, mind, consciousness, order, complexity, free will, and autonomy are all terms that have multiple, paradoxical, and inadequate definitions. No one can agree on exactly where life or mind or consciousness or autonomy begins and where it ends. The best we can agree on is that these states are not binary. They exist on a continuum." ([Kelly 2014:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=12))

"Even we adults are not 100 percent autonomous, since we depend upon other living species in our gut (such as E. coli) to aid in the digestion of our food or the breakdown of toxins. If humans are not fully autonomous, what is? An organism or system does not need to be wholly independent to exhibit some degree of autonomy. Like an infant of any species, it can acquire increasing degrees of independence, starting from a speck of autonomy." ([Kelly 2014:13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=13))

"we might say that an entity is autonomous if it displays any of these traits: self-repair, self-defense, self-maintenance (securing energy, disposing of waste), self-control of goals, self-improvement. The common element in all these characteristics is of course the emergence, at some level, of a self. In the technium we don't have any examples of a system that displays all these traits—but we have plenty of examples that display some of them. Autonomous airplane drones can self-steer and stay aloft for hours. But they don't repair themselves. Communication networks can repair themselves. But they don't reproduce themselves. We have self-reproducing computer viruses, but they don't improve themselves. Woven deep into the vast communication networks wrapping the globe, we also find evidence of embryonic technological autonomy. The technium contains 170 quadrillion computer chips wired up into one mega-scale computing platform. The total number of transistors in this global network is now approximately the same as the number of neurons in your brain. And the number of links among files in this network (think of all the links among all the web pages of the world) is about equal to the number of synapse links in your brain. Thus, this growing planetary electronic membrane is already comparable to the complexity of a human brain. It has three billion artificial eyes (phone and webcams) plugged in, it processes keyword searches at the humming rate of 14 kilohertz (a barely audible high-pitched whine), and it is so large a contraption that it now consumes 5 percent of the world's electricity. When computer scientists dissect the massive rivers of traffic flowing through it, they cannot account for the source of all the bits. Every now and then a bit is transmitted incorrectly, and while most of those mutations can be attributed to identifiable causes such as hacking, machine error, or line damage, the researchers are left with a few percent that somehow changed themselves. In other words, a small fraction of what the technium communicates originates not from any of its known human-made nodes but from the system at large. The technium is whispering to itself. Further deep analysis of the information flowing through the technium's network reveals that it has slowly been shifting its methods of organization. In the telephone system a century ago, messages dispersed across the network in a pattern that mathematicians associate with randomness. But in the last decade, the flow of bits has become statistically more similar to the patterns found in self-organized systems. For one thing, the global network exhibits self-similarity, also known as a fractal pattern." ([Kelly 2014:13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=13))

"out of all the spheres of influence upon the technium, the human mind is only one. And this influence may even be the weakest one. The technium wants what we design it to want and what we try to direct it to do. But in addition to those drives, the technium has its own wants. It wants to sort itself out, to self-assemble into hierarchical levels, just as most large, deeply interconnected systems do. The technium also wants what every living system wants: to perpetuate itself, to keep itself going. And as it grows, those inherent wants are gaining in complexity and force." ([Kelly 2014:13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=13))

"With the technium, want does not mean thoughtful decisions. I don't believe the technium is conscious (at this point). Its mechanical wants are not carefully considered deliberations but rather tendencies. Leanings. Urges. Trajectories. The wants of technology are closer to needs, a compulsion toward something. Just like the unconscious drift of a sea cucumber as it seeks a mate." ([Kelly 2014:14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=14))

"The technium is now as great a force in our world as nature, and our response to the technium should be similar to our response to nature. We can't demand that technology obey us any more than we can demand that life obey us. Sometimes we should surrender to its lead and bask in its abundance, and sometimes we should try to bend its natural course to meet our own. We don't have to do everything that the technium demands, but we can learn to work with this force rather than against it. And to do that successfully, we first need to understand technology's behavior. In order to decide how to respond to technology, we have to figure out what technology wants." ([Kelly 2014:14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=14))

"Fewer than 1,500 generations after their "great leap forward" in Africa, Homo sapiens had become the most widely distributed species in Earth's history, inhabiting every type of biome and every watershed on the planet. Sapiens were the most invasive alien species ever." ([Kelly 2014:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=17))

"Instead of acquiring a larger brain, as the Neanderthals and Erectus did, Sapiens gained a rewired brain. Language altered the Neanderthal-type mind and allowed Sapien minds for the first time to invent with purpose and deliberation." ([Kelly 2014:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=18))

"The Paleolithic rhythm actually reflects the "predator rhythm," since the great hunters of the animal world, the lion and other large cats, exhibit the same style: hunting to exhaustion in a short burst and then lounging around for days afterward." ([Kelly 2014:19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=19))

"There are no known remains of an early hominin who lived to be older than 40. Because extremely high child mortality rates depress average life expectancy, if the oldest outlier is only 40, the median age was almost certainly less than 20. A typical tribe of hunters-gatherers had few very young children and no old people. This demographic may explain a common impression visitors had upon meeting intact historical hunter-gatherer tribes. They would remark that "everyone looked extremely healthy and robust."" ([Kelly 2014:20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=20))

"Given that women would only start bearing children at 17 or so and die by their thirties, it would be common for children to lose their parents before the children were teenagers. A short life span is rotten for the individual. But a short life span is also extremely detrimental for a society as well. Without grandparents, it becomes exceedingly difficult to transmit knowledge—and knowledge of tool using—over time. Grandparents are the conduits of culture, and without them culture stagnates. Imagine a society that not only lacked grandparents but also lacked language—as the pre-Sapiens did. How would learning be transmitted over generations? Your own parents would die before you were an adult, and in any case, they could not communicate to you anything beyond what they could show you while you were immature." ([Kelly 2014:20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=20))

"In a virtuous circle, via the communication of grandparents, ever more powerful innovations carried forward were able to lengthen life spans further, which allowed more time to invent new tools, which increased population." ([Kelly 2014:21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=21))

"the most fundamental biological factor that underlies the behavioral innovations of modernity may be the increase in adult survivorship. It is no coincidence that increased longevity is the most measurable consequence of the acquisition of technology" ([Kelly 2014:21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=21))

"Within 20,000 years of the great march out of Africa, Sapiens helped exterminate 90 percent of the then-existing species of megafauna." ([Kelly 2014:21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=21))

"More than 80 percent of all large mammal genera on the planet were completely extinct by 10,000 years ago. Somehow, four species escaped this fate in North America: the bison, moose, elk, and caribou." ([Kelly 2014:21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=21))

"The death rate due to warfare was five times higher among hunter-gatherer tribes than in later agriculture-based societies (.1 percent of the population killed per year in "civilized" wars versus .5 percent in war between tribes)." ([Kelly 2014:21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=21))

"when fighting did break out, it was fierce and deadly. When the numbers of warriors on both sides were about equal, primitive tribes usually beat the armies of civilization. The Celtic tribes defeated the Romans, the Tuareg smashed the French, the Zulus trumped the British, and it took the U.S. Army 50 years to defeat the Apache tribes." ([Kelly 2014:21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=21))

"If all technology—every last knife and spear—were to be removed from this planet, our species would not last more than a few months. We are now symbiotic with technology." ([Kelly 2014:22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=22))

"Farming disturbed the soil and increased CO 2 . Some climatologists believe that this early anthropogenic warming, starting 8,000 years ago, kept a new ice age at bay." ([Kelly 2014:22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=22))

"Today the CO 2 exhalation of all machines greatly exceeds the exhalation of all animals and even approaches the volume generated by geological forces. The technium gains its immense power not only from its scale but from its self-amplifying nature. One breakthrough invention, such as the alphabet, the steam pump, or electricity, can lead to further breakthrough inventions, such as books, coal mines, and telephones. These advances in turn led to other breakthrough inventions, such as libraries, power generators, and the internet. Each step adds further powers while retaining most of the virtues of the previous inventions." ([Kelly 2014:23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=23))

"each rise in social organization throughout history was driven by an insertion of a new technology. The invention of writing unleashed the leveling fairness of recorded laws. The invention of standard minted coins made trade more universal, encouraged entrepreneurship, and hastened the idea of liberty. Historian Lynn White notes, "Few inventions have been so simple as the stirrup, but few have had so catalytic an influence on history." In White's view, the adoption of the lowly foot stirrup for horse saddles enabled riders to use weapons on horseback, which gave an advantage to the cavalry over infantry and to the lords who could afford horses, and so nurtured the rise of aristocratic feudalism in Europe." ([Kelly 2014:23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=23))

"in 1620, Francis Bacon, the godfather of modern science, realized how powerful technology was becoming. He listed three "practical arts"—the printing press, gunpowder, and the magnetic compass—that had changed the world. He declared that "no empire, no sect, no start seems to have exerted greater power and influence in human affairs than these mechanical discoveries." Bacon helped launch the scientific method, which accelerated the speed of invention" ([Kelly 2014:23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=23))

"Danny Hillis, computer scientist, believes the gears of the clock spun out science and all its many cultural descendants." ([Kelly 2014:23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=23))

"He says, "The mechanism of the clock gave us a metaphor for self-governed operation of natural law. (The computer, with its mechanistic playing out of predetermined rules, is the direct descendant of the clock.) Once we were able to imagine the solar system as a clockwork automaton, the generalization to other aspects of nature was almost inevitable, and the process of Science began."" ([Kelly 2014:24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=24))

"When technology appeared among our age-old routines, it was set outside ourselves and treated like an infection. People embraced its products, but guiltily. It would have been ludicrous a century ago to think of technology as ordained. It was a suspect force. When two world wars unleashed the full killing power of this inventiveness, it cemented the reputation of technology as a beguiling satan. As we refined this stuff through generations of technological evolution, it lost much of its hardness. We began to see through technology's disguise as material and began to see it primarily as action. While it inhabited a body, its heart was something softer. In 1949, John von Neumann, the brainy genius behind the first useful computer, realized what computers were teaching us about technology: "Technology will in the near and in the farther future increasingly turn from problems of intensity, substance, and energy, to problems of structure, organization, information, and control." No longer a noun, technology was becoming a force—a vital spirit that throws us forward or pushes against us. Not a thing but a verb." ([Kelly 2014:24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=24))

"The hard two-meter mound of a termite colony operates as if it were an external organ of the insects: The mound's temperature is regulated and it is repaired after injury. The dried mud itself seems to be living. What we think of as coral—stony, treelike structures—are the apartment buildings of nearly invisible coral animals. The coral structure and coral animals behave as one. It grows, breathes. The waxy interior of a beehive or the twiggy architecture of a bird's nest works the same way. Therefore a nest or a hive can best be considered a body built rather than grown. A shelter is animal technology, the animal extended. The extended human is the technium. Marshall McLuhan, among others, noted that clothes are people's extended skin, wheels extended feet, camera and telescopes extended eyes. Our technological creations are great extrapolations of the bodies that our genes build. In this way, we can think of technology as our extended body. During the industrial age it was easy to see the world this way. Steam-powered shovels, locomotives, television, and the levers and gears of engineers were a fabulous exoskeleton that turned man into superman. A closer look reveals the flaw in this analogy: The extended costume of animals is the result of their genes. They inherit the basic blueprints of what they make. Humans don't. The blueprints for our shells spring from our minds, which may spontaneously create something none of our ancestors ever made or even imagined. If technology is an extension of humans, it is not an extension of our genes but of our minds. Technology is therefore the extended body for ideas. With minor differences, the evolution of the technium—the organism of ideas—mimics the evolution of genetic organisms." ([Kelly 2014:25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=25))

"Just as in Darwinian evolution, tiny improvements are rewarded with more copies, so that innovations spread steadily through the population. Older ideas merge and hatch idea-lings." ([Kelly 2014:25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=25))

"Of the many ways in which a mammal differs from, say, a sponge, one of the primary differences is the additional layers in which information flows through the organism." ([Kelly 2014:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=26))

"John Maynard Smith and Eors Szathmary, who recently found eight thresholds of biological information in life's history." ([Kelly 2014:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=26))

"One replicating molecule ➔ Interacting population of replicating molecules Replicating molecules ➔ Replicating molecules strung into chromosome Chromosome of RNA enzymes ➔ DNA proteins Cell without nucleus ➔ Cell with nucleus Asexual reproduction (cloning) ➔ Sexual recombination Single-cell organism ➔ Multicell organism Solitary individual ➔ Colonies and superorganisms Primate societies ➔ Language-based societies Each level in their hierarchy marks a major advance in complexity. The invention of sex is probably the biggest step in the reordering of biological information." ([Kelly 2014:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=26))

"I have arranged the major transitions in technology according to the level at which information is organized. At each step, information and knowledge are processed at a level not present before." ([Kelly 2014:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=26))

"Primate communication ➔ Language Oral lore ➔ Writing/mathematical notation Scripts ➔ Printing Book knowledge ➔ Scientific method Artisan production ➔ Mass production Industrial culture ➔ Ubiquitous global communication No transition in technology has affected our species, or the world at large, more than the first one, the creation of language." ([Kelly 2014:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=26))

"The scientific method followed printing as a more refined way to deal with the exploding amount of information humans were generating. Via peer-reviewed correspondence and, later, journals, science offered a method of extracting reliable information, testing it, and then linking it to a growing body of other tested, interlinked facts. This newly ordered information—what we call science—could then be used to restructure the organization of matter. It birthed new materials, new processes for making stuff, new tools, and new perspectives. When the scientific method was applied to craft, we invented mass production of interchangeable parts, the assembly line, efficiency, and specialization." ([Kelly 2014:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=27))

"Within both life and the technium, the thickening of interconnections at one level weaves the new level of organization above it. And it's important to note that the major transitions in the technium begin at the level where the major transitions in biology left off: Primate societies give rise to language. The invention of language marks the last major transformation in the natural world and also the first transformation in the manufactured world. Words, ideas, and concepts are the most complex things social animals (like us) make, and also the simplest foundation for any type of technology." ([Kelly 2014:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=27))

"We can think of the technium as the further reorganization of information that began with the six kingdoms of life. In this way, the technium becomes the seventh kingdom of life." ([Kelly 2014:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=27))

"We don't know how common exaptations are in nature, but they are routine in the technium. The technium is" ([Kelly 2014:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=27))

"nothing but exaptations, since innovations can be easily borrowed across lines of origin or moved across time and repurposed. Niles Eldredge is the cofounder (with Stephen Jay Gould) of the theory of punctuated, stepwise evolution." ([Kelly 2014:28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=28))

"As a hobby he collects cornets, musical instruments very similar to trumpets." ([Kelly 2014:28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=28))

"When he mapped the evolution of cornets using techniques similar to those he applies to ancient arthropods, he found that the pattern of the lineages were very similar in many ways to those of living organisms. As one example, the evolution of cornets showed a stepwise progress, much like trilobites. But the evolution of musical instruments was also very distinctive. The key difference between the evolution of multicellular life and the evolution of the technium is that in life most blending of traits happens "vertically" in time. Innovations are passed from living parents down (vertically) through offspring. In the technium, on the other hand, most blending of traits happens laterally across time— even from "extinct" species and across lineages from nonparents. Eldredge discovered that the pattern of evolution in the technium is not the repeated forking of branches we associate with the tree of life, but rather a spreading, recursive network of pathways that often double back to "dead" ideas and resurrect "lost" traits. Another way of saying the same thing: Early traits (exaptations) anticipate the later lineages that adopt them. These two patterns were distinct enough that Eldridge claims one could use it to identify whether an evolutionary tree depicted a clan of the born or of the made." ([Kelly 2014:28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=28))

"The design heritage for each musical instrument shows how some branches borrow from far earlier models or nonadjacent branches (dotted lines), unlike organic evolution. The second difference between evolution of the technium and evolution of the organic is that incremental transformation is the rule in biology."

"In contrast, technology can jump ahead, make abrupt leaps, and skip over incremental steps.

"Today, in the United States alone, there are 5,000 amateurs who knap fresh arrowhead points by hand. They meet on weekends, exchange tips in flint-knapping clubs, and sell their points to souvenir brokers. John Whittaker, a professional archaeologist and flint knapper himself, has studied these amateurs and estimates that they produce over one million brand-new spear and arrow points per year. These new points are indistinguishable, even to experts like Whittaker, from authentic ancient ones." ([Kelly 2014:30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=30))

"From the perspective of an atom, any living organism is a tornado that might capture it into its mad frenzy of chaos and order, offering it a once-in-a-14-billion-year-lifetime fling. As fast and crazy as a cell is, the rate of energy flowing through technology is even faster. In fact, technology is more active in this respect—it will give an atom a wilder ride—than any other sustainable structure we are currently aware of. For the ultimate trip today, the most sustainable energetic thing in the universe is a computer chip." ([Kelly 2014:31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=31))

"the thing that is able to conduct the highest density of power—the most energy flowing through a gram of matter each second—lies at the core of your laptop." ([Kelly 2014:31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=31))

"the power density of a sun pales in comparison to the intense flow of energy and activity present in grass. As intense as the surface of the sun is, its mass is enormous and its lifetime is 10 billion years, so as a whole system, the amount of energy flowing through it per gram per second is less than that in a sunflower soaking up that sun's energy. An exploding nuclear bomb has a much higher power density than the sun because it is an unsustainable out-" ([Kelly 2014:31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=31))

"of-control flow of energy. A one-megaton nuclear bomb will release 10 17 ergs, which is a lot of power. But the total lifetime of that explosion is only a hyperblink of 10 -6 seconds. So if you "amortized" a nuclear blast so that it spent its energy over a full second instead of microseconds, its power density would be reduced to only 10 11 ergs per second per gram, which is about the intensity of a laptop computer chip. Energywise, a Pentium chip may be better thought of as a very slow nuclear explosion." ([Kelly 2014:32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=32))

"in the initial femtoseconds of creation there was only one thing in the universe, one superdense power that ruled all, and this solitary power expanded and cooled into thousands of variations of itself. The history of the cosmos thus proceeds from unity to diversity. As the universe stretched out, it made nothingness. As emptiness increased, so did coolness. Space permitted energy to cool into matter and for matter to slow down, light to radiate, and gravity and the other energetic forces to unfold. Energy is simply the potential—the difference needed—to cool. Energy can only flow from greater to lesser, so without a differential no energy can flow. Curiously, the universe expanded faster than matter itself could cool and gel, which means the potential for cooling kept increasing. The faster the universe expanded, the greater was its potential to cool and the greater were the potential differences within its boundaries. Over aeons of cosmic time this expanding differential (between expanding emptiness and the remnant hotness of the big bang) powered evolution, life, intelligence, and eventually the acceleration of technology." ([Kelly 2014:32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=32))

"In the first thousand years after the big bang the temperature difference within the universe was so small that it would have reached equilibrium quickly. Had not the universe kept expanding, very little interesting would have happened. But the expansion of the universe put a tilt into things. By expanding omnidirectionally—every point receding from every other point—space provided an empty bottom, a basement of sorts, down which energy could flow. The faster the cosmos enlarged, the bigger the basement it constructed. At the very bottom of the basement lies the final end state known as heat death. It is absolutely still." ([Kelly 2014:33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=33))

"This hell of uniformity is called maximum entropy." ([Kelly 2014:33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=33))

"the sole law of physics with no known exceptions anywhere in the universe is this: All creation is headed to the basement." ([Kelly 2014:33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=33))

"Because of entropy, fast-moving things slow down, order fizzles into chaos, and it costs something for any type of difference or individuality to remain unique. Each difference—whether of speed, structure, or behavior—becomes less different very quickly because every action leaks energy down the tilt. Difference within the universe is not free. It has to be maintained against the grain." ([Kelly 2014:33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=33))

"In one year 1 eagle eats 100 trout, which eat 10,000 grasshoppers, which eat 1 million blades of grass. Thus it takes, indirectly, 1 million blades of grass to support 1 eagle. But this pile of 1 million blades far outweighs the eagle. This bloated inefficiency is due to entropy. Each movement in an animal's life wastes a small bit of heat (entropy), which means every predator catches less energy than the total energy the prey consumed, and this shortfall is multiplied by each action for all time. The circle of life is kept going only by the constant replenishment of sunlight showering the grass with new energy. This inevitable waste is so harsh and unavoidable that it is astounding that any organization can persist for long without rapidly dissolving to cold equilibrium. Everything we find interesting and good in the cosmos— living organisms, civilization, communities, intelligence, evolution itself—somehow maintains a persistent difference in the face of entropy's empty indifference." ([Kelly 2014:33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=33))

"Exotropy is another word for the technical term negentropy, or negative entropy. It was originally coined by the philosopher Max More, though he spelled it extropy. I've appropriated his term with an alternative spelling to heighten its distinction from its opposite entropy. I prefer exotropy over negentropy because it is a positive term for an otherwise double negative phrase meaning "the absence of the absence of order." Exotropy, in this tale, is far more uplifting than simply the subtraction of chaos. Exotropy can be thought of as a force in its own right that flings forward an unbroken sequence of unlikely existences. Exotropy is neither wave nor particle, nor pure energy, nor supernatural miracle. It is an immaterial flow that is very much like information." ([Kelly 2014:33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=33))

"exotropy resembles, but is not equivalent to, information and that it entails self-organization. We can't make an exact informational definition of exotropy because we don't really know what information is. In fact the term information covers several contradictory concepts that should have their own terms. We use information to mean (1) a bunch of bits or (2) a meaningful signal. Confusingly, bits rise but signals decrease when entropy gains, so one kind of information increases while the other kind decreases. Until we clarify our language, the term information is more metaphor than anything else. I try to use it in the second meaning here (not always consistently): Information is a signal of bits that makes a difference. Muddying the waters further, information is the reigning metaphor of the moment. We tend to interpret the mysteries surrounding life in imagery suggested by the most complex system we are aware of at the time. Once nature was described as a body, then a clock in the age of clocks, then a machine in the industrial age. Now, in the "digital age," we apply the computational metaphor. To explain how our minds work, or how evolution advances, we apply the pattern of a very large software program processing bits of information. None of these historical metaphors is wrong; they are just incomplete." ([Kelly 2014:33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=33))

"Information and computation can't be the most complex immaterial entity there is, just the most complex we've discovered so far. We might eventually discover that exotropy involves quantum dynamics, or gravity, or even quantum gravity. But for now, information (in the sense of structure) is a better analogy than anything else we know of for understanding the nature of exotropy." ([Kelly 2014:34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=34))

"As organisms evolve, the informational code their atoms carry is manipulated, processed, and reordered. In addition to genetic information, the atoms now convey adaptive information.

"One study estimated the Earth harbored 10 30 single-cell microbes. A typical microbe, such as a yeast, produces one one-bit mutation per generation, which means one bit of unique information for every organism alive. Counting the microbes alone (about 50 percent of the biomass), the biosphere today contains 10 30 bits, or 10 29 bytes, or 10,000 yottabytes of genetic information. That's a lot. And that is only the biological information. The technium is awash in its own ocean of information. It reflects 8,000 years of embedded human knowledge. Measured by the amount of digital storage in use, the technium" ([Kelly 2014:34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=34))

"Physicist Paul Davies summarizes it well: "The secret of life does not lie in its chemical basis. . . . Life succeeds precisely because it evades chemical imperatives."

"We are steadily substituting intangible design, flexibility, innovation, and smartness for rigid, heavy atoms.

"the technium has overtaken its brainy parents. The powers of our minds can be only slightly increased by mindful self-reflection; thinking about thoughts will only make us marginally smarter. The power of the technium, however, can be increased indefinitely by reflecting its transforming nature upon itself. New technologies constantly make it easier to invent better technologies; we can't say the same about human brains. In this unbounded technological amplification, the immaterial organization of the technium has now become the most dominant force in this part of the universe. Technology's dominance ultimately stems not from its birth in human minds but from its origin in the same self-organization that brought galaxies, planets, life, and minds into existence. It is part of a great asymmetrical arc that begins at the big bang and extends into ever more abstract and immaterial forms over time.

"In all cultures prior to the 17th century or so, the quiet, incremental drift of progress was attributed to the gods, or to the one God. It wasn't until progress was liberated from the divine and assigned to ourselves that it began to feed upon itself. Sanitation made us healthier, so we could work longer. Farm tools made more food for less work. Gadgets made our homes more comfortable for tinkering with new ideas. The more inventions, the better. There was a tight feedback loop as increased knowledge enabled us to discover and manufacture more tools, and these tools allowed us to discover and learn more knowledge, and both the tools and the knowledge made our lives easier and longer. The general enlargement of knowledge and comfort and choices—and the sense of well-being—was called progress. The rise of progress coincided with the rise of technology."

"The ancient world—particularly its cities—enjoyed many fabulous inventions. Societies slowly accumulated such marvels as arch bridges, aqueducts, steel knives, suspension bridges, water mills, paper, vegetable dyes, and so on. Each of these innovations was discovered in a trial-and-error fashion. Once found, by hit or miss, they were disseminated haphazardly. Some marvels could take centuries to reach another country. This nearly random method of improvement was transformed by the tool of science. By systematically recording the evidence for beliefs and investigating the reasons why things worked and then carefully distributing proven innovations, science quickly became the greatest tool for making new things the world had ever seen. Science was in fact a superior method for a culture to learn. Once you invent science—which allows you to quickly invent many things—you have a grand lever that can propel you forward very quickly. That's what happened in the West starting approximately in the 17th century. Science catapulted society into a rapid learning. By the 18th century, science had launched the Industrial Revolution, and progress was noticeable in the growing spread of cities, increasing longevity and literacy, and the acceleration of future discoveries. But there is a puzzle. The necessary ingredients of the scientific method are conceptual and fairly low tech: a way to record, catalog, and communicate written evidence and the time to experiment. Why didn't the Greeks invent it? Or the Egyptians? A time traveler from today could journey back to that era and set up the scientific method in ancient Alexandria or Athens without much trouble. But would it catch on? Maybe not. Science is costly for an individual. Sharing results is of marginal benefit if you are chiefly seeking a better tool for today. Therefore, the benefits of science are neither apparent nor immediate for individuals. Science requires a certain density of leisured population willing to share and support failures to thrive. That leisure is generated by pre-science inventions such as the plow, grain mills, domesticated power animals, and other techniques that permit a steady surplus of food for large numbers of people. In other words, science needs prosperity and populations. Outside the reign of science and technology a growing population will collapse upon itself as it meets Malthusian limits. But inside the reign of science a growing population creates a positive feedback loop wherein more people participate in scientific innovation and purchase the results, driving more innovation, which brings better nutrition, more surplus, and more population, which feed the cycle further. Just as an engine tames its fire, channeling its explosive energy to-ward work, science tames population growth, channeling its explosive energy toward prosperity. As population rises, so does progress, and vice versa. The two growths are heavily correlated." ([Kelly 2014:45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=45))

"Clearly, the roots of progress lie deep in the structured knowledge of science and technology. But the flowering of this progressive growth seems to also need the growth of large human populations. Historian Niall Ferguson believes that on the global scale, the origins of progress lie only in expanding population. According to this theory, in order to elevate populations beyond Malthusian limits you need science, yet it is the increase in the number of humans that ultimately drives science, and then prosperity. In this virtuous circle more human minds invent more things and in turn buy more inventions, including tools, techniques, and methods that will support more humans. Therefore, more human minds equal more progress. The economist Julian Simon called human minds "the ultimate resource." In his calculation, more minds were the prime source of deep progress." ([Kelly 2014:46](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=46))

"In other words, as prosperity increases due to expanding population, fertility rates drop, which will shrink population. This might be a homeostasis feedback mechanism that reins in exponential rates of progress. Or it might be wrong." ([Kelly 2014:47](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=47))

"What countercultural force is at work prompting billions of modern, educated, working women to have three, four, or five babies?" ([Kelly 2014:48](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=48))

"an enduring global fertility rate only a little below the replacement level, say 1.9, will eventually, inevitably bring the world population to zero" ([Kelly 2014:48](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=48))

"Scenario #1 Perhaps technology makes having babies much easier, or much cheaper, though it is hard to imagine any way in which technology could make rearing three children any easier. Or perhaps there is social pressure to maintain the species or social status in having a lot of children. Maybe robotic nannies change everything and having more than two kids becomes fashionable. It is not impossible to speculate on ways to maintain a status quo. But even if global population leveled off and maintained a constant number, we don't have any experience that suggests that a stagnant population can produce rising progress. Scenario #2 While the census of human minds may decrease, we can build artificial minds, maybe even in the billions." ([Kelly 2014:48](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=48))

"Scenario #3 Rather than depending on expanding the number of human minds, maybe progress can keep advancing by bettering the average human mind. Perhaps with the aid of always-on technologies or genetic engineering or pills, the potential of individual human minds increases, and this increase propels progress. Perhaps we increase our attention span, sleep less, live longer, and consume more, produce more, create more" ([Kelly 2014:48](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=48))

"Scenario #4 We might have it all wrong. Maybe prosperity has nothing to do with increasing numbers of minds. Maybe consumption has no part in progress. We simply figure out how to increase living quality, choices, and possibilities with fewer and fewer people (who live longer and longer). It's a very green vision, but also very alien to our current system. If every year there are fewer people as my potential audience or my potential customers, I have to create things for a different reason than growth in audience or customers. A nongrowth economy is hard to imagine. But stranger things have happened. Scenario #5 Our population plunges to small remnants, which in desperation breed madly and prosper. World population oscillates up and down. If the origins of prosperity lie solely in growth of the human population, then progress will paradoxically temper itself in the coming century."

"The accelerating progress of the last 200 years has indisputably been fueled by an exponential increase in cheap, abundant energy.

"if evolution displays an attraction to universal solutions, then so will technology, its accelerated extension. In recent decades science has discovered that complex adaptive systems (of which evolution is one example) tend to settle (all other factors being equal) into a few recurring patterns. These patterns are not found in the parts of the system, and so the structure that appears is considered both "emergent" and dictated by the complex adaptive system as a whole. Since the same structure will appear again and again seemingly from nowhere—like a vortex that instantly appears among water molecules in a draining tub—these structures can also be considered inevitable. With some perplexity biologists file in the bottom drawer of their desks an ever-growing list of identical phenomenon that have kept reappearing in life on Earth. They are not sure what to do with these curious cases. But a few scientists believe these recurring inventions are biological "vortices," or familiar patterns that emerge from the complex interactions in evolution. The estimated 30 million species coinhabiting Earth are running millions of experiments every hour. They constantly breed, fight, kill, or mutually alter each other. Out of this exhaustive recombination, evolution keeps converging upon similar characteristics in far-flung branches in the tree of life. This attraction to recurring forms is called convergent evolution." ([Kelly 2014:51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=51))

"in a universe as large as ours, once you landed on a distant star one hundred random hops away, you would never reach it again by the same random process. It is statistically impossible. But that is what evolution did with rhodopsin. Out of all the protein stars in the universe, it found this one—a protein that has not been improved upon for billennia—twice."

"the match of environmental niche is usually the reason given for occurrences of convergent evolution." ([Kelly 2014:53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=53))

"even within parallel environments it is very rare to arrive at the same morphological solution. Contingency and luck are so strong in evolution that the marvel is that convergence ever happens. Based on the number of possible forms that can be assembled from the molecules of life and the central role of random mutation and deletion in shaping them, significant convergence from independent origins should be as scarce as miracles. But a hundred, or a thousand, cases of isolated significant convergent evolution suggest something else at work. Some other force pushes the self-organization of evolution toward recurring solutions. A" ([Kelly 2014:53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=53))

"It is not a supernatural force but a fundamental dynamic as simple at its core as evolution itself. And it is the same force that funnels convergence in technology and culture. Evolution is driven toward certain recurring and inevitable forms by two pressures: 1. The negative constraints cast by the laws of geometry and physics, which limit the scope of life's possibilities. 2. The positive constraints produced by the self-organizing complexity of interlinked genes and metabolic pathways, which generate a few repeating new possibilities. These two dynamics create a push in evolution that gives it a direction. Both of these two dynamics continue to operate in the technium as well and shape the inevitabilities along the course of the technium." ([Kelly 2014:53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=53))

"the dimensions of each species are not arbitrary. They follow a scale ratio that is astonishingly constant in both plants and animals. This ratio is dictated by the physics of water. The strength of a cell wall is determined by the surface tension of water; that constant in turn mandates the maximum height per width of a body, any possible body. These physical forces play out not just on Earth, but everywhere in the universe, so we might expect any organisms based on water, whenever and wherever they evolve, to converge upon this same universal size ratio (adjusted for local gravity)." ([Kelly 2014:54](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=54))

"The metabolism of life is likewise constrained. Small animals live fast and die young. Big animals plod along. The speed of life for animals—the rate at which their cells burn energy, the speed of their muscle twitches, the time it takes them to gestate or to mature—is remarkably proportional to their life span and size. Both metabolic rate and heart rate are proportional to the mass of the creature. These constants derive from the fundamental rules of physics and geometry and the natural advantages to minimizing energy surfaces (lung surface, cell surface, circulatory capacity, etc.). While a mouse's heart and lungs beat rapidly compared to an elephant's, both mouse and elephant count the same number of beats and breaths per life. It is as if mammals are assigned 1.5 billion heartbeats and told to use them as they like." ([Kelly 2014:54](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=54))

"Dilute pools of cool oceanic algae can be thought of as a slow-motion version of a warm-blooded heart. The amount of energy per kilogram (or energy density) flowing through a plant or ecosystem is equivalent to metabolism. Many life processes—from the number of hours of sleep an animal needs to the hatching time for its eggs to the rate at which a forest accumulates wood mass to the mutation rate in DNA—all seem to follow a universal metabolism scaling law." ([Kelly 2014:54](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=54))

"James Gillooly and Geoffrey West, the researchers who discovered this law. "Metabolic rate is the fundamental biological rate," they claim—"a universal clock" reckoned in energy, the speed at which all life of any type proceeds. The clock is inevitable for anything living. Other physical constants run through the biological world. Bilateral symmetry (mirrored left and right sides) recurs in almost every family of life. This fundamental symmetry seems to bring adaptive advantage on many levels, from superior balance of movement to prudent redundancy (two of everything!) to efficient compression of genetic code (just duplicate the first side). Other geometric forms, like a tube for nutrient transport in plants or animals (a gut) or legs, are just plain good physics. Some recurring designs, such as the arboreal splay of branches in a tree and coral or the swirling spiral of petals on a flower, are based on the mathematics of growth. They repeat because the math is eternal. All life on Earth is protein based, and the way those proteins fold and unfold inside cells determines the character traits and behaviors of that creature. Biochemists Michael Denton and Craig Marshall state that "recent advances in protein chemistry suggest that at least one set of biological forms—the basic protein folds—is determined by physical laws similar to those giving rise to crystals and atoms. They give every appearance of being invariant platonic forms."" ([Kelly 2014:54](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=54))

"Carbon sits at the center of life because it is gregarious and contains so many hooks for other elements to bind to. It has a particularly friendly relationship with oxygen. Carbon is easily oxidized as fuel for animals and easily unoxidized (reduced) by chlorophyll in plants. And of course it forms the backbone for long chains of incredibly diverse megamolecules. Silicon, carbon's sister element, is the most likely alternative candidate to produce a non-carbon-based life form. Silicon also is very prolific in its hooking up with a variety of elements, and it is more abundant on the planet than carbon. When science-fiction authors dream up alternative life forms, they are often based on silicon. But in real life silicon suffers from a few major drawbacks. It does not link up into chains with hydrogen, limiting the size" ([Kelly 2014:55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=55))

"of its derivatives. Silicon-silicon bonds are not stable in water. And when silicon is oxidized, its respiratory output is a mineral precipitate, rather than the gaslike carbon dioxide. That makes it hard to dissipate. A silicon creature would exhale gritty grains of sand. Basically, silicon produces dry life. Without a liquid matrix it's hard to imagine how complex molecules are transported around to interact. Perhaps silicon-based life inhabits a fiery world and the silicates are molten. Or perhaps the matrix is very cold liquid ammonia. But unlike ice, which floats and insulates the unfrozen liquid, frozen ammonia sinks, allowing the oceans to freeze whole." ([Kelly 2014:56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=56))

"A potential synthetic life base created in the lab might be robust enough to survive on its own in the wild but fail to organize itself into existence. If you can skip the need for a self-made birth, you can jump to all kinds of complex systems that would never evolve on their own. (This is in fact the "job" of minds: to produce types of complexity that evolutionary self-creation cannot.) Robots and AIs don't need to self-organize from metal-laden rocks because they are made rather than born." ([Kelly 2014:56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=56))

"it is the paucity of alternatives that is the strongest evidence for inevitability. In chlorophyll's case, no alternative forms appear after billions of years in spite of its imperfection, and in rhodopsin's case, despite a few minor competitors, the same molecule was found twice in an otherwise vast empty field." ([Kelly 2014:56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=56))

"The technium can't make all imaginable inventions or all possible ideas. Rather, the technium is limited in many directions by the constraints of matter and energy." ([Kelly 2014:57](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=57))

"the variation presented to natural selection is not always random . Experiments show that "random" mutations are often not unbiased; instead, variation is governed by geometry and physics; and most important, variations are often shaped by the possibilities inherent in the recurring patterns of self-organization (a la whirlpool vortex). Once upon a time the notion of nonrandom variation was heresy, but as more and more biologists ran computer models, the idea that variation is not random became a scientific consensus among certain theoreticians. Self-regulating networks of genes (found in all chromosomes) favor certain kinds of complexes. "Some potentially useful mutations are so probable that they can be viewed as being encoded implicitly in the genome," says biologist L. H. Caporale. Metabolic pathways in cells can autocatalyze themselves into a network and drift into self-preferred loops. This flips the traditional view. In the old view, the internal (the source of mutation) created change, while the external (the environmental source of adaptation) selected or directed it; in the new view, the external (physical and chemical constraints) creates forms, while the internal (selforganization) selects or directs them. And when the internal directs, it redirects to recurring forms. As the early paleontologist W. B. Scott put it, the complexity of evolution creates "inherited channels for preferred change.""

"Whereas contingency can be thought of as a "historical" force, that is, a phenomenon where history matters, the structural component of evolution's engine can be thought of as "ahistorical" in that it produces change independent of history.

"The evolution of a species is like a meandering river as it carves away land. The detailed "particular-ness" of that river, the profile of its fine contours along the shore and bottom, comes from the vectors of adaptive mutations and contingency (never to be repeated), but the universal "riverness" form of the river (recurring in all rivers) as it is channeled in a valley comes from the internal gravity of convergence and emergent order."

"The biologist Brian Goodwin proposed that "all the main morphological features of organisms— hearts, brains, guts, limbs, eyes, leaves, flowers, roots, trunks, branches, to mention only the obvious ones—are the emergent results of morphogenic principles" and would reappear if the tape of life was rewound. Like other recurring archetypes, they are patterns your brain perceives without your even noticing it." ([Kelly 2014:59](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=59))

"It is almost as if life has an imperative. It "wants" to materialize certain patterns. Even the physical world seems biased in that direction. There are many indications that our neighborhood of the universe is biased toward the appearance of life. Our planet is just close enough to the sun to be warm but far enough away to not burn. Earth has a large nearby moon that slows down its rotation to lengthen the day and to stabilize it over the long term. Earth shares the sun with Jupiter, which acts as a comet magnet. The ice of those captured comets may also have given Earth its oceans. Earth has a magnetic core, which generates a cosmic ray shield. It has the appropriate level of gravity to retain water and oxygen. It has a thin crust, which enables the churn of plate tectonics. Each of these variables seems to sit in a Goldilocks zone of not too little and not too much. Recent research suggests that there's a Goldilocks zone in the galaxy as well. Too close to the center of the galaxy and a planet is bombarded by constant, lethal cosmic radiation; too far from the center and when the planetary mass condenses from star dust it will be lacking the heavy elements that are needed for life. Our solar system is smack in the middle of this just-right zone. Such a list can quickly get out of hand to include every aspect of life on Earth. It's all perfect!"

"multiple runs of evolution produced similar traits in the phenotype—the outward body of the bacteria. Changes in the genotype occurred in roughly the same places, though the exact coding was often different. This suggests a convergence of broad form with details left to chance."

"The particular physical arrangements of matter, energy, and information that produce the ingenious molecules of rhodopsin or chlorophyll or DNA or the human mind are so scarce in the space of all possible "could be" things that they are statistically improbable almost to the point of being impossible. Every organism (and artifact) is a wholly improbable arrangement of its constituent atoms. Yet within the long chain of reproducing self-organization and restless evolution, these forms become highly probable, and even inevitable, because there are only a few ways such open-ended ingenuity can actually work in the real world; therefore, evolution must" ([Kelly 2014:60](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=60))

"The appearance of morphological archetypes would further suggest that this technological invention has a direction, a tilt. A tilt that is independent to a certain extent of its human inventors. Indeed, in all fields of technology we commonly find independent, equivalent, and simultaneous invention. If this convergence indicated that discoveries were inevitable, the inventors would appear as conduits filled by an invention that just had to happen. We would expect the people making them to be interchangeable, if not almost random. That is exactly what psychologist Dean Simonton found. He took Ogburn and Thomas's catalog of simultaneous invention before 1900 and aggregated it with several other similar lists to map out the pattern of parallel discovery for 1,546 cases of invention. Simonton plotted the number of discoveries made by 2 individuals against the number of discoveries made by 3 people, or 4 people, or 5, or 6. The number of 6-person discoveries was of course lower, but the exact ratio between these multiples produced a pattern known in statistics as a Poisson distribution. This is the pattern you see in mutations on a DNA chromosome and in other rare chance events in a large pool of possible agents. The Poisson curve suggested that the system of "who found what" was essentially random. Certainly talent is unequally distributed. Some innovators (like Edison, or Isaac Newton, or William Thomson Kelvin) are simply better than others. But if geniuses aren't able to jump far ahead of the inevitable, how do the better inventors become great? Simonton discovered that the higher the prominence of a scientist (as determined by the number of pages his biography occupies in encyclopedias), the greater the number of simultaneous discoveries he participated in. Kelvin was involved in 30 sets of simultaneous discoveries." ([Kelly 2014:63](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=63))

"After Rowling launched Harry Potter in 1997 to great success, she successfully rebuffed a lawsuit by an American author who published a series of children's books 13 years earlier about Larry Potter, an orphaned boy wizard wearing glasses and surrounded by Muggles.

Or keep in mind a 1991 story by Jane Yolen about Henry, a boy who attends a magical school for young wizards and must overthrow an evil wizard. Then there's The Secret of Platform 13, published in 1994, which features a gateway on a railway platform to a magical underworld. There are many good reasons to believe J. K. Rowling when she claims she read none of these (for instance, very few of the Muggle books were printed and almost none were sold; and Gaiman's teenage-boy comics don't usually appeal to single moms) and many more reasons to accept the fact that these ideas arose in simultaneous spontaneous creation.

In addition to instruments and tools, a discovery needs the proper beliefs, expectations, vocabulary, explanation, know-how, resources, funds, and appreciation to appear. But these, too, are fueled by new technologies. An invention or discovery that is too far ahead of its time is worthless; no one can follow.

Decades later science faced the urgent questions that Mendel's discoveries could answer. Now his insights were only one step away. Within a few years of one another, three different scientists (Hugo de Vries, Karl Erich Correns, and Erich Tschermak) each independently rediscovered Mendel's forgotten work, which of course had been there all along.

The smaller the model, the better it flew. Engelbart imagined how the benefits of scaling down, or as he called it, "similitude," might transfer to a new invention SRI was tracking—multiple transistors on one integrated silicon chip. Perhaps as they were made smaller, circuits might deliver a similar kind of magical similitude: the smaller a chip, the better. Engelbart presented his ideas on similitude to an audience of engineers at the 1960 Solid State Circuits Conference that included Gordon Moore, a researcher at Fairchild Semiconductor, a start-up making the integrated chips." ([Kelly 2014:74](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=74))

"Silicon computation is not simply getting better, but getting better faster and faster. Relentless acceleration for five decades is rare in biology and unknown in the technium before this century. So this graph is as much about the phenomenon of cultural acceleration as about silicon chips. In fact, Moore's Law has come to represent the principle of an accelerating future that underpins our expectations of the technium. Second, even a cursory glance reveals the astounding regularity of Moore's line. From the earliest points its progress has been eerily mechanical." ([Kelly 2014:74](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=74))

"Writing in 2005, on the 40th anniversary of his law, Moore says, "Moore's Law is really about economics." Carver Mead made it clearer yet: Moore's Law, he says, "is really about people's belief system, it's not a law of physics, it's about human belief, and when people believe in" ([Kelly 2014:74](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=74))

"something, they'll put energy behind it to make it come to pass." In case that was not clear enough, he spells it out further: After [it] happened long enough, people begin to talk about it in retrospect, and in retrospect it's really a curve that goes through some points and so it looks like a physical law and people talk about it that way. But actually if you're living it, which I am, then it doesn't feel like a physical law. It's really a thing about human activity, it's about vision, it's about what you're allowed to believe. Finally, in another reference, Carver Mead adds: "Permission to believe that [the law] will keep going" is what keeps the law going. Gordon Moore agreed in a 1996 article: "More than anything, once something like this gets established, it becomes more or less a self-fulfilling prophecy. The Semiconductor Industry Association puts out a technology road map, which continues this [generational improvement] every three years. Everyone in the industry recognizes that if you don't stay on essentially that curve they will fall behind. So it sort of drives itself." Clearly, expectations of future progress guide current investments, not just in semiconductors but in all aspects of technology. The invariant curve of Moore's Law helps focus money and intelligence on very specific goals—keeping up with the law. The only problem with accepting self-constructed goals as the source of such regular progress is that other technologies that might benefit from the same belief do not show the same zooming rise. Why don't we see Moore's Law type of growth in the performance of jet engines or steel alloys or corn hybrids if this is simply a matter of believing in a self-fulfilling prophecy?" ([Kelly 2014:75](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=75))

"this steady acceleration is more than an agreement. It originates within the technology. There are other technologies, also solid-state materials, that exhibit a steady curve of progress, just as in Moore's Law. They, too, seem to obey a rough law of remarkably steady exponential improvement." ([Kelly 2014:75](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=75))

"In the inner circle of the tech industry the fast-paced drop in prices for magnetic storage is called Kryder's Law. It's the Moore's Law for computer storage" ([Kelly 2014:75](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=75))

"In Kryder's own words: "There is no direct relationship between Moore's Law and Kryder's Law. The physics and fabrication processes are different for the semiconductor devices and magnetic storage. Hence, it is quite possible that semiconductor scaling could stop while scaling of disk drives continues."" ([Kelly 2014:75](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=75))

"Rob Carlson has been tabulating progress in DNA sequencing and synthesis. Graphed similarly to Moore's Law in cost performance per base pair, this technology, too, displays a steady drop when plotted on a log axis. If computers did not get better, faster, cheaper each year, would DNA sequencing and synthesis continue to accelerate? Carlson says: "If Moore's Law stopped, I don't think it would have much effect. The one area it might affect is processing the raw sequence information into something comprehensible by humans. Crunching the data of DNA is at least as expensive as getting the sequence of the physical DNA."" ([Kelly 2014:75](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=75))

"The exponential growth of magnetic storage began in 1956, almost a whole decade before Moore formulated his law for semiconductors and 50 years before Kryder formulized the existence of its slope. Rob Carlson says, "When I first published the DNA exponential curves, I got reviewers claiming that they were unaware of any evidence that sequencing costs were falling exponentially. In this way the trends were operative even when people disbelieved it." Inventor and author Ray Kurzweil dug into the archives to show that something like Moore's Law had its origins as far back as 1900, long before electronic computers existed, and of course long before the path could have been constructed by self-fulfillment. Kurzweil estimated the number of calculations per second per $1,000 performed by turn-of-the-century analog machines, by mechanical calculators, and later by the first vacuumtube computers and extended the same calculation to modern semiconductor chips. He established that this ratio increased exponentially for the past 109 years. More important, the curve (let's call it Kurzweil's Law) transects five different technological species of computation: electromechanical, relay, vacuum tube, transistors, and integrated circuits. An unobserved constant operating in five distinct paradigms of technology for over a century must be more than an industry road map. It suggests that the nature of these ratios is baked deep into the fabric of the technium." ([Kelly 2014:76](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=76))

"I gathered as many examples of current exponential progress as I could find." ([Kelly 2014:77](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=77))

"all these examples demonstrate the effects of scaling down, or working with the small. We don't find exponential improvement in scaling up, as in making skyscrapers or space stations ever larger. Airplanes aren't getting bigger, flying faster, or becoming more fuel efficient at an exponential rate. Gordon Moore jokes that if the technology of air travel experienced the same kind of progress as Intel chips, a modern-day commercial aircraft would cost $500, circle the Earth in 20 minutes, and only use five gallons of fuel for the trip. However, the plane would only be the size of a shoebox! In this microcosmic realm, unlike the macroworld we live in, energy is not very important. That is why we don't see a Moore's Law type of progress at work when scaling up: energy requirements scale up just as fast, and energy is a major limiting constraint, unlike information, which can be duplicated freely. This is also why we don't see exponential progress in the performance of solar panels (only linear progress) or batteries— because they generate or store lots of energy. So our entire new economy is built around technologies that need little energy and scale down well—photons, electrons, bits, pixels, frequencies, and genes. As these inventions miniaturize, they reach closer to bare atoms, raw bits, and the essence of the immaterial. And so the fixed and inevitable path of their progress derives from this elemental essence." ([Kelly 2014:77](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=77))

"Every one of these parameters is getting twice as better every year or two. What's up with that? Engineer Mark Kryder's explanation is that "twice as better every two years" is an artifact of corporate structure, where most of these inventions happen. It just takes one to two years of calendar time to conceive, design, prototype, test, manufacture, and market a new improvement, and while a fiveor 10-fold increase is very difficult to achieve, almost any engineer can deliver a factor of two." ([Kelly 2014:77](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=77))

"this suggests that while the steady trajectory of progress stems directly from the technium, the actual angle of incline is not a supernatural number (doubling every 18 months) but is simply dependent on human work cycles. At the moment there is no end in sight for any of these curves, but at some point in the future, each curve will plateau. Moore's Law will not continue forever. That's just life. Any specific exponential growth will inevitably smooth out into a typical S-shaped curve." ([Kelly 2014:77](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=77))

"Much of the churn in the technium is due to our tendency to shift what we care about. Mastering one technology engenders new technological desires." ([Kelly 2014:78](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=78))

"consumers shrugged off the increasing number of pixels because the current resolution was sufficient. Their concern instead shifted to the speed of the pixel sensors or the response in low light—things no one had cared about before. So a new metric is born, and a new curve started, and the exponential curve of ever more pixels per array will gradually abate." ([Kelly 2014:78](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=78))

"we may already have enough transistors per chip to do what we want, if only we knew how." ([Kelly 2014:78](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=78))

"As one curve inevitably flattens out, its momentum is taken up by another S curve" ([Kelly 2014:78](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=78))

"close scrutiny of Kryder's Law in hard-disk densities shows that it is composed of a sequence of overlapping smaller trend lines. The first hard-disk technology, ferrite oxide, ran from 1975 to 1990. The second technology, thin film, had a slightly better performance and slightly faster acceleration and overlapped ferrite oxide, running from 1985 to 1995. The third technological innovation, magneto resistance, began in 1993 and improved at a still faster rate. Their slightly uneven slopes combine to yield an unwavering trajectory." ([Kelly 2014:78](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=78))

"as the performance metric of chips is constantly recalibrated from one technological stage to the next, Moore's Law—redefined— will never end." ([Kelly 2014:79](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=79))

"If in a counterfactual history, communism had won the cold war and microelectronics had been invented in a global Soviet-style society, my guess is that even that alternative policy apparatus could not stifle Moore's Law. Progress might roll out slower at a lower slope, maybe with a doubling time of five years, but I don't doubt that Stalinist scientists would tap into the law of the microcosm and soon marvel at the same technical wonder we do" ([Kelly 2014:79](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=79))

"Our choice, and it is significant, is to prepare for the gift—and the problems it will also bring. We can choose to get better at anticipating these inevitable surges. We can choose to educate ourselves and our children to become intelligently literate and wise in their employment. And we can choose to modify our legal and political and economic assumptions to meet the ordained trajectories ahead. But we cannot escape from them. When we spy our technological fate in the distance, we should not reel back in horror of its inevitability; rather, we should lurch forward in preparation."

"At the AT&T pavilion they had a working picture phone." ([Kelly 2014:81](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=81))

"45 years later" ([Kelly 2014:81](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=81))

"Our picture phone was exactly what everyone imagined it to be, except in three significant ways: the device was not exactly a phone, it was our iMac and her laptop; the call was free (via Skype, not AT&T); and despite being perfectly useable, and free, picture-phoning has not become common—even for us." ([Kelly 2014:81](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=81))

"The picture phone was imagined in sufficient detail a number of times, in different eras and different economic regimes. It really wanted to happen. One artist sketched out a fantasy of it in 1878, only two years after the telephone was patented. A series of working prototypes were demoed by the German post office in 1938. Commercial versions, called Picturephones, were installed in public phone booths on the streets in New York City after the 1964 World's Fair, but AT&T canceled the product ten years later due to lack of interest."

"There's an old story about the long reach of early choices that is basically true: Ordinary Roman carts were constructed to match the width of imperial Roman war chariots because it was easier to follow the ruts in the road left by the war chariots. The chariots were sized to accommodate the width of two large warhorses, which translates into our English measurement of 4' 8.5". Roads throughout the vast Roman Empire were built to this specification. When the legions of Rome marched into Britain, they constructed long-distance imperial roads 4' 8.5" wide. When the English started building tram-ways, they used the same width so the same horse carriages could be used. And when they started building railways with horseless carriages, naturally the rails were 4' 8.5" wide. Imported laborers from the British Isles built the first railways in the Americas using the same tools and jigs they were used to. Fast-forward to the U.S. space shuttle, which is built in parts around the country and assembled in Florida. Because the two large solid-fuel rocket engines on the side of the launch shuttle were sent by railroad from Utah, and that line traversed a tunnel not much wider than the standard track, the rockets themselves could not be much wider in diameter than 4' 8.5". As one wag concluded: "So, a major design feature of what is arguably the world's most advanced transportation system was determined over two thousand years ago by the width of two horses' arse." More or less, this is how technology constrains itself over time." ([Kelly 2014:83](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=83))

"The primary driver is preordained development— what technology wants. The second driver is the influence of technological history, the gravity of the past, as in the way the size of a horse's yoke determines the size of a space rocket. The third force is society's collective free will in shaping the technium, or our choices. Under the first force of inevitability, the path of technological evolution is steered both by the laws of physics and by self-organizing tendencies within its large, complex, adaptive system. The technium will tend toward certain macroforms, even if you rerun the tape of time. What happens next is contingent on the second force, or what has already happened, and so the momentum of history constrains our choices forward. These two forces channel the technium along a limited path and severely restrict our choices. We like to think that "anything is possible next," but in fact anything is not possible in technology. In contrast to these two, the third force is our free will to make individual choices of use and collective policy decisions." ([Kelly 2014:83](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=83))

"It is no coincidence that the triadic nature of the technium is the same as the triadic nature of biological evolution." ([Kelly 2014:84](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=84))

"One vector is the inevitable. The basic laws of physics and emergent self-organization drive evolution toward certain forms. Specific species (either biological or technological) are unpredictable in their microdetails, but the macropatterns (electrical motors, binary computing) are ordained by the physics of matter and self-organization. This inescapable force can be thought of as the structural inevitability of biological and technological evolution (shown as the lower left corner in the diagram above). The second corner of the triad is the historical/contingent aspect of evolutionary change (lower right). Accidents and circumstantial opportunities bend the course of evolution this way and that, and those contingencies add up over time to create ecosystems with their own internal momentum. The past matters. The third force working within evolution is the adaptive function—the relentless engine of optimization and creative innovation that con-tinually solves the problems of survival. In biology this is the incredible force of unconscious, blind natural selection (shown as the top corner)." ([Kelly 2014:84](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=84))

"In biological evolution there is no designer, but in the technium there is an intelligent designer—Sapiens. And of course, this conscious open design (shown as the top corner) is why the technium has become the most powerful force in the world. The other two legs of technological evolution are identical to the other two legs of biological evolution." ([Kelly 2014:84](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=84))

"It is the third leg, the collective choice of free-willed individuals, that provides the character of the technium. And just as our free-will choices in our individual lives create the kind of person we are (our ineffable "person"), our choices, too, shape the technium." ([Kelly 2014:84](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=84))

"The better we can forecast, the better we can be prepared for what comes. If we can discern the large outlines of persistent forces, we can better educate our children in the appropriate skills and literacies need for thriving in that world. We can shift the defaults in our laws and public institutions to reflect that coming reality. If, for instance, we realize that everyone's full DNA will be sequenced from birth or before (that is inevitable), then instructing everyone in genetic literacy becomes essential. Each must know the limits to what can and cannot be gleaned from this code, how it varies or does not among related individuals, what might impact its integrity, what information about it can be shared, what concepts such as "race" and "ethnicity" mean in this context, and how to use this knowledge to get therapeutics tailored to it."

"Evolution "wants" risky teenagers. Knowing that risky behavior is expected in adolescence is both reassuring to teenagers (you are normal, not a freak) and to society (they will grow out of it) and an invitation to harness that normal riskiness for improvement and gain."

"there comes a moment in the childhood of our biological offspring when their childish selfish nature confronts us, and we have to acknowledge that they have their own agenda. Even though their very own life is an unambiguous continuation of our life (all their cells derive uninterrupted from our cells), our children have their own life. No matter how many babies we have seen, we are unsettled each time these moments of independence arrive. Collectively we are at one of these moments with the technium. We encounter this natural life cycle every day in biology, but this is the first time we have met it in technology, and it is unnerving us. Our shock at meeting selfishness in technology has to do with the fact that, by definition, we are, and will always remain, part of the technium itself. In the words of psychologist Sherry Turkle, technology is our "second self." It is both "other" and "us." Unlike our biological children, who grow up to have minds completely separate from us, the technium's autonomy includes us and our collective minds. We are part of its selfish nature." ([Kelly 2014:86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=86))

"Humans are both master and slave to the technium, and our fate is to remain in this uncomfortable dual role. Therefore, we will always be conflicted about technology and find making our choices difficult." ([Kelly 2014:86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=86))

"We are beyond embrace; we are already symbiotic with it. At a macroscale, the technium is following its inevitable progression. Yet at the microscale, volition rules. Our choice is to align ourselves with this direction, to expand choice and possibilities for everyone and everything, and to play out the details with grace and beauty. Or we can choose (unwisely, I believe) to resist our second self. The conflict that the technium triggers in our hearts is due to our refusal to accept our nature—the truth is that we are continuous with the machines we create. We are self-made humans, our own best invention. When we reject technology as a whole, it is a brand of self-hatred. "We trust in nature, but we hope in technology," says Brian Arthur. That hope lies in embracing our own natures." ([Kelly 2014:86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=86))

"In 1917 Orville Wright predicted that "the aeroplane will help peace in more ways than one—in particular I think it will have a tendency to make war impossible." He was echoing earlier sentiments from American journalist John Walker, who declared in 1904, "As a peace machine, the value [of the aeroplane] to the world will be beyond computation." This wasn't the first grand promise of technology. In that same year Jules Verne announced, "The submarine may be the cause of bringing battle to a stoppage altogether, for fleets will become useless, and as other war material continues to improve, war will become impossible." Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite and founder of the Nobel Prize, sincerely believed his explosives would be a war deterrent: "My dynamite will sooner lead to peace than a thousand world conventions." In the same vein, when Hiram Maxim, inventor of the machine gun, was asked in 1893, "Will this gun not make war more terrible?" he answered, "No, it will make war impossible." Guglielmo Marconi, inventor of the radio, told the world in 1912, "The coming of the wireless era will make war impossible, because it will make war ridiculous." General James Harbord, chairman of the board of RCA in 1925, believed, "Radio will serve to make the concept of Peace on Earth, Good Will Toward Men a reality." Not long after the telephone was commercialized in the 1890s, John J. Carty, AT&T's chief engineer, prophesied, "Someday we will build up a world telephone system, making necessary to all peoples the use of a common language or common understanding of languages, which will join all the people of the Earth into one brotherhood. There will be heard throughout the Earth a great voice coming out of the ether which will proclaim, 'Peace on Earth, good will towards men.'" Nikola Tesla claimed that his invention of "the economic transmission of power without wire . . . will bring peace and harmony on Earth.""

"It is not that all these inventions are without benefits—even benefits toward democracy. Rather, it's the case that each new technology creates more problems than it solves." ([Kelly 2014:88](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=88))

"Most of the new problems in the world are problems created by previous technology. These technogenic problems are nearly invisible to us. Every year 1.2 million people die in automobile accidents. The dominant technological transportation system kills more people than cancer." ([Kelly 2014:88](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=88))

"The divorce of the hands from the head puts a strain on the human psyche. Indeed, the sedentary nature of the best-paying jobs is a health hazard—for body and mind.

"Only 1,000 years ago, medieval technology was ubiquitous on the periphery of human relationships, but not central. Today technology places itself in the middle of everything we do, see, hear, and make. Technology has permeated eating, romance, sex, child rearing, education, death. Our lives run on clock time. As the most powerful force in the world, technology tends to dominate our thinking. Because of its ubiquity, it monopolizes any activity and questions any nontechnological solution as unreliable or impotent. Because of its power to augment us, we give precedence to the made over the born. Which do we expect to more be effective, a wild herb or an engineered drug? Even our cultural compliments for excellence have drifted to the mechanical: "smooth as glass," "bright and shiny," "sterling," "watertight," and "like clockwork"—all suggesting the superiority of the man-made. We have become imprisoned in the technological framework of what the poet William Blake called "the mind-forg'd manacles." Simply the fact that a machine is able to perform a task often becomes sufficient reason to have it do the task, even if it does it poorly at first. The first machine-made versions of things, such as garments, china bowls, writing paper, baskets, and canned soups, were not very good, just very cheap. Often we will invent a machine for a particular and limited purpose, and then, in what Neil Postman calls the Frankenstein syndrome, the invention's own agenda blossoms. "Once the machine is built," Postman writes, "we discover, always to our surprise—that it has ideas of its own; that it is quite capable not only of changing our habits but . . . of changing our habits of mind." In this way, humans have become an adjunct to or, in Karl Marx's phrase, appendages of the machine." ([Kelly 2014:89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=89))

"One third of the Earth's land surface is already altered by agriculture and human habitation." ([Kelly 2014:89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=89))

"We have historical evidence for the extinction of about 2,000 species in the last 2,000 years, or one per year, or four times the natural rate. The bulk of those extinctions, however, are in the last 200 years, so the known annual average today is significantly higher. Since we have identified about 5 percent of all species on Earth, and many of those yet-to-be-named species are in the same vanishing habitats as the documented extinctions, we can extrapolate what the total number of species going extinct might be. These estimates run at the higher end of 50,000 per year." ([Kelly 2014:89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=89))

"In the long term, the erosion of the traditional self may prove to be a larger part of the technium's cost than its erosion of the biosphere. Langdon Winner suggests there is a kind of conservation of life force: "Insofar as men pour their own life into the apparatus, their own vitality is that much diminished. The transference of human energy and character leaves men empty, although they may never acknowledge the void." That transference is not inevitable, but it does happen. As machines take over more of what humans once did, we tend to do less of the familiar. We don't walk as much, letting our autos do our walking. We don't dig anymore, except with backhoes. We don't hunt for food, we don't gather. We don't hammer or sew. We don't read if we don't have to. We don't calculate. We are in the process of offloading our remembering to Google, and we are eager to stop cleaning as soon as those cleaning bots get cheap enough. Eric Brende, an engineering student who spent two years living like an Amish, says, "Duplicating vital human capacities can have one of only two consequences: atrophying the capacities or creating competition between Homo sapiens and machine. Neither of these is savory to self-respecting members of the former." Technology chips away at our human dignity, calling into question our role in the world and our own nature."

"About 10,000 years ago, humans passed a tipping point where our ability to modify the biosphere exceeded the planet's ability to modify us. That threshold was the beginning of the technium.

"it is more akin to an organism. It is not inert, nor passive; rather, the technium seeks and grabs resources for its own expansion. It is not merely the sum of human action, but in fact it transcends human actions and desires." ([Kelly 2014:90](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=90))

"I have read almost every book on the philosophy and theory of technology and interviewed many of the wisest people pondering the nature of this force.

([Kelly 2014:91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=91))

"Kacyznski was misled because he followed logic divorced from ethics, but as befits a mathematician, his logic was insightful. As best I understand, the Unabomber's argument goes like this: • Personal freedoms are constrained by society, as they must be in any civilization for the sake of order. • The stronger that technology makes the society, the less individual freedom there is. • Technology destroys nature, strengthening itself further. • But because it is destroying nature, the technium will ultimately collapse. • In the meantime, the ratchet of technological self-amplification is stronger than politics. • Using technology to try to tame the system only strengthens the technium. • Because it cannot be tamed, technological civilization must be destroyed rather than reformed. • Since it cannot be destroyed by technology or politics, humans must push the technium toward its inevitable self-collapse. • Then we should pounce on it when it is down and kill it before it rises again." ([Kelly 2014:91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=91))

"Kaczynski argues that it is impossible to escape the ratcheting clutches of industrial technology for several reasons: one, because if you use any part of the technium, the system demands servitude; two, because technology does not "reverse" itself, never releasing what is in its hold; and three, because we don't have a choice of what technology to use in the long run." ([Kelly 2014:92](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=92))

"Amish population grows at 4 percent annually" ([Kelly 2014:99](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=99))

"Amish lives are anything but antitechnological. In fact, on my several visits with them, I have found them to be ingenious hackers and tinkerers, the ultimate makers and do-it-yourselfers. They are often, surprisingly, protechnology." ([Kelly 2014:99](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=99))

"The Amish are not a monolithic group. Their practices vary parish by parish." ([Kelly 2014:99](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=99))

"Most Amish use a mixture of old and very new stuff, like the rest of us." ([Kelly 2014:99](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=99))

"the view of the Amish as old-fashioned Luddites is an urban myth." ([Kelly 2014:99](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=99))

"The Amish, particularly the Old Order Amish—the stereotypical Amish on postcards—really are reluctant to adopt new things." ([Kelly 2014:99](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=99))

"Some orders require the buggy to be an open carriage (so riders—teenagers, say—are not tempted by a private place to fool around); others will permit closed carriages. Some orders allow tractors on the farm, if the tractors have steel wheels; that way a tractor can't be "cheated" to drive on the road like a car. Some groups allow farmers to power their combines or threshers with diesel engines, as long as the engine only spins the threshers and does not propel the vehicle—which means the whole smoking, noisy contraption is pulled by horses. Some sects allow cars, but only if they are painted entirely black (no chrome) to ease the temptation to upgrade to the latest model. Behind all of these variations is the Amish motivation to strengthen their communities. When cars first appeared at the turn of the last century, the Amish noticed that drivers would leave the community to go picnicking or sightseeing in other towns, instead of visiting family or the sick on Sundays or patronizing local shops on Saturday. Therefore, the ban on unbridled mobility was intended to make it hard to travel far and to keep energy focused in the local community. Some parishes did this with more strictness than others. A similar communal motivation lies behind the Old Order Amish practice of living without electricity. The Amish noticed that when their homes were electrified with wires from a generator in town, they became more tied to the rhythms, policies, and concerns of the town. Amish religious belief is founded on the principle that they should remain "in the world, not of it" and so should remain separate in as many ways as possible." ([Kelly 2014:99](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=99))

"The Old Order won't own a pickup truck, but they will ride in one. They won't get a license, purchase an automobile, pay insurance, and become dependent on the automobile and the industrial-car complex, but they will call a taxi. Since there are more Amish men than farms, many men work at small factories, and these guys will hire vans driven by outsiders to take them to and from work. So even the horse-and-buggy folk will use cars—on their own terms. (Very thrifty, too.) The Amish also make a distinction between technology they have at work and technology they have at home." ([Kelly 2014:100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=100))

"The diesel engine burned petroleum fuel to drive the compressor that filled the reservoir with pressure. From the tank, a series of highpressure pipes snaked off toward every corner of the factory. A hard rubber flexible hose connected each tool to a pipe. The entire shop ran on compressed air. Every piece of machinery was running on pneumatic power." ([Kelly 2014:100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=100))

"The Amish call this pneumatic system "Amish electricity." At first, pneumatics were devised for Amish workshops, but air power was seen as so useful that it migrated to Amish households. In fact, there is an entire cottage industry in retrofitting tools and appliances to run on Amish electricity. The retrofitters buy a heavy-duty blender, say, and yank out the electrical motor. They then substitute an air-powered motor of appropriate size, add pneumatic connectors" ([Kelly 2014:100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=100))

"They love to show off their geekiest hacks. And every tinkerer I met claimed that pneumatics were superior to electrical devices because air was more powerful and durable, outlasting motors that burned out after a few years of hard labor." ([Kelly 2014:100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=100))

"a few years ago they installed a $400,000 computer-controlled milling machine in his backyard, behind the horse stable. This massive tool was about the size of a delivery truck. It was operated by Marlin's 14-year-old daughter, in a bonnet and long dress. With this computer-controlled machine she made parts for grid-free horse-and-buggy living. I say "grid-free" rather than "electricity-free" because I kept finding electricity in Amish homes. Once you have a huge diesel generator running behind your barn to power the refrigeration units that store the milk (the main cash crop for the Amish), it's a small thing to stick on a small electrical generator. For recharging batteries, say. You can find battery-powered calculators, flashlights, and electric fences and generator-powered electric welders on Amish farms. The Amish also use batteries to run a radio or phone (outside in the barn or shop), or to power the required headlights and turn signals on their horse buggies." ([Kelly 2014:100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=100))

"Nowadays solar panels are becoming popular among the Amish." ([Kelly 2014:100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=100))

"The Amish use disposable diapers (why not?), chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, and they are big boosters of genetically modified corn." ([Kelly 2014:101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=101))

"the technology of genetically modified crops allowed the Amish to continue using old, well-proven, debt-free equipment, which accomplished their main goal of keeping the family farm together." ([Kelly 2014:101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=101))

"Artificial insemination, solar power, and the web are technologies that Amish are still debating. They use the web at libraries (using but not owning). In fact, from cubicles in public libraries Amish sometimes set up a website for their business." ([Kelly 2014:101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=101))

"The typical adoption pattern for a new technology goes like this: Ivan is an Amish alpha geek. He is always the first to try a new gadget or technique. He gets in his head that the new flowbitzmodulator would be really useful. He comes up with a justification of how it fits into the Amish orientation. So he goes to his bishop with this proposal: "I'd like to try this out." The bishop says to Ivan, "Okay, Ivan, do whatever you want with this. But you have to be ready to give it up if we decide it is not helping you or is hurting others." So Ivan acquires the tech and ramps it up, while his neighbors, family, and bishops watch intently. They weigh the benefits and drawbacks. What is it doing to the community? To Ivan? Cell-phone use among the Amish began that way. According to anecdote, the first Amish alpha geeks to request permission to use cell phones were two ministers who were also contractors. The bishops were reluctant to give permission but suggested a compromise: Keep the cell phones in the vans of the drivers. The van would be a mobile phone shanty. Then the community would watch the contractors. It seemed to work, so other early adopters picked it up. But still, at any time, even years later, the bishops can say no." ([Kelly 2014:101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=101))

"My impression is that the Amish are living about 50 years behind us." ([Kelly 2014:102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=102))

"They don't adopt everything new, but when they do embrace it, it's half a century after everyone else does. By that time, the benefits and costs are clear, the technology stable, and it is cheap. The Amish are steadily adopting technology—at their pace. They are slow geeks. As one Amish man said, "We don't want to stop progress, we just want to slow it down." But their manner of slow adoption is instructive: 1. They are selective. They know how to say no and are not afraid to refuse new things. They ignore more than they adopt. 2. They evaluate new things by experience instead of by theory. They let the early adopters get their jollies by pioneering new stuff under watchful eyes. 3. They have criteria by which to make choices: Technologies must enhance family and community and distance themselves from the outside world. 4. The choices are not individual but communal. The community shapes and enforces technological direction." ([Kelly 2014:102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=102))

"If the Amish had to generate all their own energy, grow all their clothing fibers, mine all metal, harvest and mill all lumber, they would not be Amish at all because they would be running large machines, dangerous factories, and other types of industry that would not sit well in their backyards (one of the criteria they use to decide whether a craft is appropriate for them). But without someone manufacturing this stuff, they could not maintain their lifestyle or prosperity. In short, the Amish depend on the outside world for the way they currently live. Their choice of minimal technology adoption is a choice—but a choice enabled by the technium. Their lifestyle is within the technium, not outside it." ([Kelly 2014:104](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=104))

"As far as I can tell, there are no other ongoing large-scale communities based outside North America that have built a lifestyle around minimal technology. That's because outside technological America the idea seems crazy. This opt-out option makes sense only when there is something to opt out of. The original Amish protesters (or Protestants) were indistinguishable from neighboring European peasants." ([Kelly 2014:104](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=104))

"simplicity worked best in community, that the solution wasn't no technology but some technology, and that what seem to work best were the low-tech solutions we called "appropriate technology." This tie-dyed, deliberate, conscious engagement with appropriate technology was deeply satisfying for a while." ([Kelly 2014:104](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=104))

"The Whole Earth Catalog, which I edited at one point, was the field manual for those millions of simple technology experiments." ([Kelly 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=105))

"I got to witness close up how the early enthusiasm for restricted technology would inevitably give way to unease and restlessness. Slowly the hippies drifted away from their deliberately low-tech world. One by one they left their domes for suburban garages and lofts where, much to our collective astonishment, many of them transformed their small-is-beautiful skills into small-is-start-up entrepreneurship. The origins of the Wired generation and the long-hair computer culture (think open-source UNIX) lay in the counterculture dropouts of the 70s. As Stewart Brand, hippie founder of the Whole Earth Catalog, remembers, "'Do your own thing' easily translated into 'Start your own business.'" I've lost count of the hundreds of individuals I personally know who left communes to eventually start high-tech companies in Silicon Valley." ([Kelly 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=105))

"Voluntary simplicity is a possibility, an option, a choice that one should experience for at least part of one's life. I highly recommend elective poverty and minimalism as a fantastic education, not least because it will help you sort out your technology priorities. But I have observed that simplicity's fullest potential requires that one consider minimalism one phase of many (even if a recurring phase, as is meditation or the Sabbath). In the past decade, a new generation of minimites has arisen, and they are now urban homesteading—living lightly in cities, supported by ad hoc communities of like-minded homesteaders. They are trying to have both—the Amish satisfaction of intense mutual aid and hand labor and the ever-cascading choices of a city. Because of my own personal journey from low tech to high choice, I admire Leon and Berry and Brende and the Old Order Plain Folk communities. I am convinced that the Amish and minimites are more content and satisfied as people than the rest of us fast-forward urban technophiles. In their deliberate constraint of technology they have figured out how to optimize an alluring combination of leisure, comfort, and certainty over the optimization of uncertain possibilities. The honest truth is that as the technium explodes with new self-made options, we find it harder to find fulfillment. How can we be fulfilled when we don't know what is being filled?" ([Kelly 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=105))

"It is only possible to optimize human satisfaction if you believe human nature is fixed. Needs cannot be maximally satisfied if they are in flux. Minimal technologists maintain that human nature is unchanging." ([Kelly 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=105))

"If the nature of humans is indeed invariant, then it is possible to achieve a peak technological solution to support it." ([Kelly 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=105))

"For Berry, technology peaked in 1940, about the moment when all these farm implements were as good as they could get. In his eyes, and in those of the Amish, too, the elaborate circular solution of a small, mixed family farm, where the farmer produces plant feed for the animals, who produce manure (power and food to" ([Kelly 2014:105](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=105))

"grow more plants), is the perfect pattern for the health and satisfaction of a human being, human society, and the environment." ([Kelly 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=106))

"it seems pure foolishness, if not the height of conceit and hubris, to believe that in the long course of human history, and by that I mean the next 10,000 years in addition to the past 10,000 years, the peak of human invention and satisfaction should turn out to be 1940. It is no coincidence that this date also happens to be the time when Wendell Berry was a young boy growing up on a farm with horses. Berry seems to follow Alan Kay's definition" ([Kelly 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=106))

""Technology," Kay says, "is anything that was invented after you were born."" ([Kelly 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=106))

"We know that genetically our bodies are changing faster now than at any time in the past million years. Our minds are being rewired by our culture. With no exaggeration and no metaphor, we are not the same people who first started to plow 10,000 years ago. The snug interlocking system of horse and buggy, wood-fire cooking, compost gardening, and minimal industry may be perfectly fit for a human nature—of an ancient agrarian epoch. But this devotion to a traditional way of being ignores the way in which our nature—our wants, desires, fears, primeval instincts, and loftiest aspirations—is being recast by ourselves and by our inventions, and it excludes the needs of our new natures. We need new jobs in part because we are new people at our core. We are different physical beings from our ancestors. We think differently. Our educated and literate brains work differently." ([Kelly 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=106))

"The Amish find incredible contentment in their enactment of a fixed human nature. This deep human fulfillment is real, visceral, renewable, and so attractive that Amish numbers are doubling every generation. But I believe the Amish and minimites have traded contentment for revelation. They have not discovered, and cannot discover, who they can become. That's their choice, which is fine as far as it goes. And because it is a choice, we should celebrate their development of it." ([Kelly 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=106))

"To maximize our own contentment, we seek the minimum amount of technology in our lives. Yet to maximize the contentment of others, we must maximize the amount of technology in the world. Indeed, we can only find our own minimal tools if others have created a sufficient maximum pool of options we can choose from. The dilemma remains in how we can personally minimize stuff close to us while trying to expand it globally." ([Kelly 2014:107](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=107))

"Although we don't realize it, at the global scale, we opt out of more technology than we opt in to." ([Kelly 2014:108](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=108))

"The Amish, however, select or deny technology as a group. By contrast, in secular modern culture, particularly in the West, technology choices are made individually, as a personal decision." ([Kelly 2014:108](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=108))

"Much of the success of the Amish is due to the unwavering community-wide support (bordering on social coercion) for their unorthodox technology lifestyle." ([Kelly 2014:108](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=108))

"Large-scale prohibitions against technologies are rare. They are hard to enforce. And my research shows most don't last much longer than the normal obsolescence cycle of accepted technology. A handful of prohibitions lasted several hundred years in an era when it took technology several hundred years to change. The gun was outlawed in Shogun Japan for three centuries, exploration ships in Ming China for three centuries, and silk" ([Kelly 2014:108](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=108))

"spinning in Italy for two centuries. Few others in history lasted as long. The guild of French scribes succeeded in delaying the introduction of printing into Paris, but only for 20 years." ([Kelly 2014:109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=109))

"Genetically modified foods have a reputation for being outlawed, and indeed some countries do ban them, but the acreage dedicated to growing genetically modified plant crops is increasing at 9 percent per year globally. Although prohibited by some nations, the amount of power delivered by nuclear power plants is increasing globally by 2 percent a year." ([Kelly 2014:109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=109))

"Technologies can be postponed but not stopped." ([Kelly 2014:109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=109))

"Thomas Edison believed his phonograph would be used primarily to record the last-minute bequests of the dying. The radio was funded by early backers who believed it would be the ideal device for delivering sermons to rural farmers. Viagra was clinically tested as a drug for heart disease. The internet was invented as a disaster-proof communications backup. Very few great ideas start out headed toward the greatness they eventually achieve. That means that projecting what harm may come from a technology before it "is" is almost impossible. With few exceptions technologies don't know what they want to be when they grow up. An invention requires many encounters with early adopters and collisions with other inventions to refine its role in the technium. Like people, young technologies often experience failure in their first careers before they find a better livelihood later. It's a rare technology that remains in its original role right from the start." ([Kelly 2014:110](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=110))

"We make prediction more difficult because our immediate tendency is to imagine the new thing doing an old job better. That's why the first cars were called "horseless carriages." The first movies were simply straightforward documentary films of theatrical plays. It took a while to realize the full dimensions of cinema photography as its own new medium that could achieve new things, reveal new perspectives, do new jobs. We are stuck in the same blindness. We imagine e-books today as being regular books that appear on electronic paper instead of as radically powerful threads of text woven into the one shared universal library. We think genetic testing is like blood testing, something you do once in your life to get an unchanging score, when sequencing our genes may instead become something we do hourly as our genes mutate, shift, and interact with our environment." ([Kelly 2014:110](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=110))

"The advertisers pitched the telephone as if it were a more convenient telegraph. None of them suggested having a conversation. The automobile today, embedded in its matrix of superhighways, drive-through restaurants, seat belts, navigation tools, and digital hypermiling dashboards, is a different technology from the Ford Model T of 100 years ago." ([Kelly 2014:110](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=110))

"There are no technologies without vices and none that are neutral." ([Kelly 2014:111](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=111))

"The greater the promise of a new technology, the greater its potential for harm as well." ([Kelly 2014:111](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=111))

"Every good produces harm somewhere, so by the strict logic of an absolute Precautionary Principle no technologies would be permitted. Even a more liberal version would not permit new technologies in a timely manner. Whatever the theory, as a practical matter we are unable to address all risks, independent of their low probability, while efforts to address all improbable risks hinders more likely potential benefits." ([Kelly 2014:111](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=111))

"In fact, Perrow concludes, safety devices and safety procedures themselves often create new accidents. Safety components can become one more opportunity for things to go wrong. For instance, adding security forces at an airport can increase the number of people with access to critical areas, which is a decrease in security. Redundant systems, normally a safety backup, can easily breed new types of errors. These are called substitute risks." ([Kelly 2014:112](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=112))

"Crops raised without the shield of pesticides generate more of their own natural pesticides to combat insects, but these indigenous toxins are not subject to the Precautionary Principle because they aren't "new." The risks of new plastic water pipes are not compared with the risks of old" ([Kelly 2014:112](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=112))

"metal pipes. The risks of DDT are not put in context with the old risks of dying of malaria." ([Kelly 2014:113](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=113))

"paradoxically, the Amish are far more scientific than most secular professionals about which technology they adopt. Typical nonreligious consumers tend to accept technology "on faith" based on what the media says, with no testing at all. In contrast, the Amish perform four levels of empirical testing on a potential technology. Instead of hypothetical worst-case-scenario precaution, the Amish employ evidence-based technological assessment. First, they discuss among themselves (sometimes in councils of their elders) the expected community consequences of an upcoming innovation." ([Kelly 2014:114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=114))

"Second, they closely monitor the actual effect of use among a small set of early adopters to see if their observations confirm their hypothesis." ([Kelly 2014:114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=114))

"And third, will the elders remove a technology if it appears to be undesirable based on observed effect and then assess the impact of its removal to further confirm their hypothesis? Was the community as a whole any better off without this technology? Last, they constantly reevaluate." ([Kelly 2014:114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=114))

"None of this is quantitative; the results are compressed into anecdotes. Stories about what happened to so-and-so with such-and-such technology are retold in gossip or printed in the pages of their newsletters and become the currency of this empirical testing. Technologies are nearly living things. Like all evolving entities, they must be tested in action, by action." ([Kelly 2014:114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=114))

"The principle of constant engagement is called the Proactionary Principle." ([Kelly 2014:114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=114))

"This framework was first articulated by Max More, radical transhumanist, in 2004. More began with ten guidelines, but I have reduced his ten principles to five proactions." ([Kelly 2014:114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=114))

"1. Anticipation" ([Kelly 2014:114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=114))

"Scenarios, forecasts, and outright science fiction give partial pictures, which is the best we can expect. Objective scientific measurement of models, simulations, and controlled experiments should carry greater weight, but these, too, are only partial. Actual early data should trump speculation. The anticipation process should try to imagine as many horrors as glories, as many glories as horrors, and if possible to anticipate ubiquity; what happens if everyone has this for free? Anticipation should not be a judgment." ([Kelly 2014:114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=114))

"2. Continual Assessment" ([Kelly 2014:114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=114))

"By means of embedded technology we can turn daily use of technologies into large-scale experiments. No matter how much a new technology is tested at first, it should be continuously retested in real time." ([Kelly 2014:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=115))

"3. Prioritization of Risks, Including Natural Ones" ([Kelly 2014:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=115))

"Known and proven threats to human and environmental health are given precedence over hypothetical risks. Furthermore, the risks of inaction and the risks of natural systems must be treated symmetrically." ([Kelly 2014:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=115))

"avoid underweighting natural risks" ([Kelly 2014:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=115))

"4. Rapid Correction of Harm" ([Kelly 2014:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=115))

"When things go wrong—and they always will—harm should be remedied quickly and compensated in proportion to actual damages" ([Kelly 2014:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=115))

"The software industry may offer a model for quick correction: Bugs are expected; they are not a reason to kill a product; instead they are employed to better the technology." ([Kelly 2014:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=115))

"5. Not Prohibition but Redirection" ([Kelly 2014:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=115))

"Prohibition and relinquishment of dubious technologies do not work. Instead, find them new jobs." ([Kelly 2014:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=115))

"Since banning fails, redirect technologies into more convivial forms." ([Kelly 2014:115](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=115))

"DDT was an ecological disaster when assigned as an aerially sprayed insecticide on cotton crops. But restricted to the task of a household malaria remedy it shines as a public-health hero. Same technology, better job." ([Kelly 2014:116](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=116))

"The power of self-replication is now found in four fields of high technology: geno, robo, info, and nano." ([Kelly 2014:116](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=116))

"In addition to all the usual difficulties that new technologies present—shifting capabilities, unintended roles, hidden consequences—self-replicating technologies add two more: amplification and acceleration." ([Kelly 2014:117](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=117))

"In one sense, self-amplifying GRIN-ologies are bullies, rogue technologies. They will need our utmost attention in order to be trained for consistent goodness. We need to invent appropriate long-term training technologies to guide them across the generations. The worst thing to do is banish and isolate them. Rather, we want to work with the bullying problem child. High-risk technologies need more chances for us to discover their true strengths. They need more of our investment and more opportunities to be tried. Prohibiting them only drives them underground, where their worst traits are emphasized."

"the proper response to a lousy idea is not to stop thinking. It is to come up with a better idea. Indeed, we should prefer a bad idea to no ideas at all, because a bad idea can at least be reformed, while not thinking offers no hope." ([Kelly 2014:118](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=118))

"In his book Tools for Conviviality, the educator and philosopher Ivan Illich defined convivial tools as those that "enlarge the contribution of autonomous individuals and primary groups. . . ." Illich believed that certain technologies were inherently convivial, while others, such as "multilane highways and compulsory education," were destructive no matter who ran them." ([Kelly 2014:118](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=118))

"conviviality resides not in the nature of a particular technology but in the job assignment, in the context, in the expression we construct for the technology. A tool's conviviality is mutable. A convivial manifestation of a technology offers: • Cooperation. It promotes collaboration between people and institutions. • Transparency. Its origins and ownership are clear. Its workings are intelligible to nonexperts. There is no asymmetrical advantage of knowledge to some of its users. • Decentralization. Its ownership, production, and control are distributed. It is not monopolized by a professional elite. • Flexibility. It is easy for users to modify, adapt, improve, or inspect its core. Individuals may freely choose to use it or give it up. • Redundancy. It is not the only solution, not a monopoly, but one of several options. • Efficiency. It minimizes impact on ecosystems. It has a high efficiency for energy and materials and is easy to reuse." ([Kelly 2014:118](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=118))

"these are all traits that make biology useful to us and the reasons why life can sustain its own evolution indefinitely. So the more lifelike we train our technology to be, the more convivial it becomes for us and the more sustainable the technium becomes in the long run." ([Kelly 2014:118](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=118))

"Extrapolated, technology wants what life wants: Increasing efficiency Increasing opportunity Increasing emergence Increasing complexity Increasing diversity Increasing specialization Increasing ubiquity Increasing freedom Increasing mutualism Increasing beauty Increasing sentience Increasing structure Increasing evolvability" ([Kelly 2014:120](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=120))

"more of these exotropic qualities." ([Kelly 2014:121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=121))

"According to many food experts, the problem with the current food-production system is that it is heavily dependent on monocultures (not diverse) of too few staple crops (five worldwide), which in turn require pathological degrees of intervention with drugs, pesticides, and herbicides, soil disturbance (reduced opportunities), and overreliance on cheap petro fuels for both energy and nutrients (reduced freedoms). Alternative scenarios that can scale up to the global level are hard to imagine, but there are hints that a decentralized agriculture, with less reliance on politically motivated government subsidies or petroleum or monocultures, might work. This evolved system of hyperlocal, specialized farms might be manned either by a truly globally mobile migrant labor force or by smart, nimble worker robots." ([Kelly 2014:121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=121))

"this type of advanced gardening would lean toward more diversity, more opportunities, more complexity, more structure, more specialization, more choices, and more sentience. This new, more convivial agriculture would sit "on top" of industrial agriculture in the same way industrial farming sits on top of subsistence farming, which is still the norm for most of the farmers alive today" ([Kelly 2014:121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=121))

"Petrol-based farming will inevitably remain the largest global producer of food for many decades. The trajectories of the technium point toward a more sentient, diverse agriculture intelligently layered over it" ([Kelly 2014:121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=121))

"Physicist Seth Lloyd counts 42 other theoretical definitions of complexity, all of them equally inadequate in real life. While we await a practical mathematical definition of complexity, there is plenty of factual evidence that intuitive "complexity"—loosely defined—exists and is increasing. Some of the most prominent evolutionary biologists don't believe there is an innate long-term trend toward complexity in evolution—or in fact any direction to evolution whatsoever. But a relatively new group of renegade biologists and evolutionists has amassed a convincing case for the broad rise of complexity across all epochs of evolutionary time." ([Kelly 2014:122](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=122))

"The slow ratchet of biological complexity was imported from antecedent structures such as galaxies and stars. Like life, these exotropic self-organized systems teeter on the edge of persistent disequilibrium. They don't burn out like a chaotic flame or explosion (they are persistent) but rather sustain their flux (disequilibrium) over long periods of time without settling into predictable patterns or equilibrium. Their order is neither chaotic nor periodic but semiregular, like a DNA molecule. This type of long-lasting, nonrandom, nonrepeating complexity found in, say, the stable atmosphere of a planet served as the platform for the long-lasting, nonrandom, nonrepeating order in life. In exotropic forms of organization, whether in a star or in genes, effective complexity accrues over time. The complexity of a system rises in a series of steps, where" ([Kelly 2014:122](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=122))

"each higher level congeals into a new wholeness. Think of a mass of stars swirling as one galaxy or a mass of cells becoming a multicellular organism. Like with a ratchet, exotropic systems rarely reverse, devolve, or become simpler." ([Kelly 2014:123](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=123))

"At each escalating step, the logical, informational, and thermodynamic depth of the resulting organization increased. It became more difficult to compress the structure, and at the same time it contained less randomness and less predictable order. Each step was also irreversible. In general, multicellular lineages do not re-evolve into single-cell organisms; sexual reproducers rarely evolve into parthenogens; social insects rarely unsocialize; and to the best of our knowledge, no replica-tor with DNA has ever given up genes. Nature will sometimes simplify, but it rarely devolves down a level." ([Kelly 2014:123](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=123))

"Just as in nature, the number of simple manufactured objects continues to increase. Brick, stone, and concrete are some of the earliest and simplest technologies, yet by mass they are the most common technologies on Earth. And they compose some of the largest artifacts we make: cities and skyscrapers. Simple technologies fill the technium in the way bacteria fill the biosphere. There are more hammers made today than at any time in the past. Most of the visible technium is, at its core, non-complex technology. But as in natural evolution, a long tail of ever-complexifying arrangements of information and materials fills our attention, even if those complex inventions are small in mass. (Indeed, demassification is one avenue of complexification.) Complex inventions stack up information rather than atoms. The most complex technologies we make are also the lightest and least material." ([Kelly 2014:123](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=123))

"Our body size is, weirdly, almost exactly in the middle of the size of the universe. The smallest things we know about are approximately 30 orders of magnitude smaller than we are, and the largest structures in the universe are about 30 orders of magnitude bigger. We inhabit a middle scale that is sympathetic to sustainable flexibility in the universe's current physics. Bigger bodies encourage rigidity; smaller ones encourage empheralization. As long as we own bodies—and what happy being does not want to be embodied? —the infrastructure technology we already have will continue (in general) to work: roads of stone, buildings of modified plant material and Earth, elements not that different from our cities and homes 2,000 years ago." ([Kelly 2014:125](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=125))

"I think there is a "complex enough" restraint. Technologies need not complexify to be useful in the future. Danny Hillis, computer inventor, once confided that he believed that there's a good chance that 1,000 years from now computers might still be running programming code from today, say a UNIX kernel. They almost certainly will be binary digital. Like bacteria or cockroaches, these simpler technologies remain simple, and remain viable, because they work."

"Where do wealthy people travel to? Places that retain differences. What eateries attract customers? The ones with distinctive characteristics. What products sell in a global market? Ones that think different. If such local diversity can remain distinctively different while it is connected (and this is a very big if), then that difference becomes steadily more valuable in a global matrix. Maintaining that balance of connected-butdifferent is a challenge, of course, because much of this cultural difference and diversity originated via isolation, and in the new mix it no longer will be isolated. Cultural differences that thrive without isolation (even if they were born out of it) will compound in value as the world becomes standardized.

"In our rush toward large-scale intelligenation, we first installed the general-purpose PC, with its mass-produced small brain, midsize screen, and conduit to the net. So all chores get the same tool. To complete the dispersion of intelligenation into all occupations will probably require another decade. Silly as it now sounds, we will put artificial intelligence into hammers, dental picks, forklifts, stethoscopes, and frying pans. All these tools will gain new powers by sharing the universal intelligence of the network. But as their newly augmented roles become clear, the tools will specialize. We can see the first glimmers in the iPhone, Kindle, Wii, tablets, and netbooks. As display and battery technology catches up to chips, the interface to ubiquitous intelligenation will diverge and specialize. Soldiers and other athletes who use their full body want large-scale, enveloping screens, while mobile road warriors will want small ones. Gamers want minimal latency; readers want maximum legibility; hikers want waterproofing; kids want indestructibility. The portals into the grid of computation, or the net, will specialize to a remarkable degree. The keyboard, for one, will lose its monopoly. Speech and gesture input will gain a major role. Spectacle and eyeball screens will supplement walls and flexible surfaces." ([Kelly 2014:131](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=131))

"We took a long list of problems that seemed to require rational planning or paternal government and instead applied the astoundingly powerful invention of marketplace logic. In most cases, the market solution worked significantly better. Much of the prosperity in recent decades was gained by unleashing market forces into the technium. Now we're trying the same trick with the emerging technologies of collaboration, applying these techniques to a growing list of wishes—and occasionally to problems that the free market couldn't solve—to see if they work. We are asking ourselves, What can't technological mutualism do? So far, the results have been startling. At nearly every turn, the powers of socialization—sharing, cooperation, collaboration, openness, and transparency—have proven to be more practical than anyone thought possible. Each time we try it, we find that the power of mutuality is greater than we imagined. Each time we reinvent something, we'll make it yet more mutualistic."

"Every living organism today has benefited from four billion years of evolution, so every creature alive—from a spherical diatom to a jellyfish to a jaguar—displays a depth that we see as beauty.

"Our technophilia is driven by the inherent beauty of the technium. Admittedly, this beauty has been previously hidden by a primitive phase of development that was not very pretty. Industrialization was dirty, ugly, and dumb in comparison to the biological matrix it grew from. A lot of that stage of the technium is still with us, spewing its ugliness. I don't know whether this ugliness is a necessary stage of the technium's growth or whether a smarter civilization than we could have tamed it earlier, but the arc of technology's origins from life's evolution, now accelerated, means that the technium contains all of life's inherent evolutionary beauty— waiting to be uncovered. Technology does not want to remain utilitarian. It wants to become art, to be beautiful and "useless."" ([Kelly 2014:142](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=142))

"Perhaps a hundred years from now people will carry around "phones" simply because they like to carry things, even though they may be connected to the net by something they wear. In the future, we'll find it easier to love technology. Machines win our hearts with every step they take in evolution. Like it or not, animal-like robots (at the level of pets, at first) will gain our affections, as even minimally lifelike ones do already. The internet provides a hint of the passion possible. Like many loves, it begins with infatuation and obsession. The global internet's nearly organic interdependence and emerging sentience make it wild, and its wildness draws our affections. We are deeply attracted to its beauty, and its beauty resides in its evolution. Humans are the most complex, highly evolved organisms we have encountered, so we fixate on imitations of this form (quite naturally), but our technophilia is fundamentally not for anthropy, but for anything highly evolved. Humanity's most advanced technology will soon leave imitation behind and create obviously nonhuman intelligences and obviously nonhuman robots and obviously non-Earthlike life, and all these will radiate an evolved attractiveness that will dazzle us."

"For many millions of years, rock ants have used a mathematical trick that was only discovered by humans in 1733. Rock ants can estimate the volume of a space, even an irregularly shaped one, by laying a scent trail across the floor of the space, "recording" the length of that line, and then counting the number of times they encounter that scented line during additional diagonal runs across the floor. The calculated area is inversely proportional to the frequency of intersections times length. In other words, the ants discovered an approximate value for pi derived by intersecting diagonals, a technique now known in mathematics as Buffon's Needle. Headroom in the potential ant house is measured by the ants with their bodies and then "multiplied" with the calculated area to give an approximate volume of their hole. But these incredible tiny ant minds do more. They measure the width and numbers of entrances, the amount of light, the proximity of neighbors, and the degree of hygiene of the room. Then they tally these variables and calculate a desirability score for the potential nest by a process that resembles a "weighted additive" fuzzy-logic formula in computer science. All in 100,000 neurons." ([Kelly 2014:143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=143))

"plants demonstrate a slow version of problem solving that fits most of our definitions of animal intelligence. They perceive their environment in great detail, they assess threats and competition, then take action to either adapt or remedy the problems, and they anticipate future states. Time-lapse motion pictures that speed up the action of vine tendrils probing their neighborhood make it clear that plants are closer to animals in their behavior than our fast lives permit us to see."

"Like sensitive fingers, roots will caress the soil, seeking out moisture and nutrients much as a nose or trunk of a herbivore might dig in the earth. The ability of a leaf to follow the sun (heliotropism) to gain optimal light exposure can be replicated in a machine, but only by using a fairly sophisticated computer chip as a brain. A plant thinks without a brain. It uses a vast network of transducing molecular signals instead of electronic nerves to carry and process information. Plants exhibit all the characteristics of intelligence, except they do it without a centralized brain and in slow motion. Decentralized minds and slow minds are actually quite common in nature and occur at many levels throughout the six kingdoms of life. A slime-mold colony can solve the shortest distance to food in a maze, much like a rat. The animal immune system, whose primary purpose is to distinguish between self and nonself, retains a memory of outside antigens it has encountered in the past. It learns in a Darwinian process and in a sense also anticipates future variations of antigens." ([Kelly 2014:144](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=144))

"charismatic intelligence evolved independently three times: in birds on wing, in mammals that returned to the sea, and in primates. Still, charismatic intelligence is relatively rare. But smartness is a competitive advantage everywhere. We see the widespread recurrence and reinvention of intelligence because the living universe is a place where learning makes a difference. Up and down the six kingdoms of life, minds have evolved many times. So many times, in fact, that minds seem inevitable. Yet as inordinately fond as nature is of minds, the technium is even more so. The technium is rigged to birth minds. All the inventions we have constructed to assist our own minds—our many storage devices, signal processing, flows of information, and distributed communication networks—all these are also essential ingredients for producing new minds. And so new minds spawn in the technium in inordinate degrees. Technology wants mindfulness." ([Kelly 2014:144](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=144))

"The technium is primed to hijack matter and rearrange its atoms to infiltrate it with sentience." ([Kelly 2014:144](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=144))

"If the technium continues to prevail, some level of sentience will find its way into everything it creates. The smallest bolt or plastic knob will contain as many decision-making circuits as a worm" ([Kelly 2014:145](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=145))

"We are blind to this massive eruption of minds into the technium because humans have a chauvinistic bias against any kind of intelligence that does not precisely mirror our own." ([Kelly 2014:145](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=145))

"while we weren't watching, billions of tiny, insectlike artificial minds spawned deep into the technium, doing invisible, low-profile chores" ([Kelly 2014:145](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=145))

"the coming AI will most likely not be confined in a stand-alone supercomputer but will be birthed in the superorganism of a billion CPUs known as the web. It will run on the global megacomputer that encompasses the internet, all its services, all peripheral chips and affiliated devices from scanners to satellites, and the billions of human minds entangled in this global network. Any device that touches this web AI will share—and contribute to—its intelligence. This gargantuan machine already exists in a primitive form today. Consider the virtual supercomputer of all the world's computers online." ([Kelly 2014:145](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=145))

"All the transistors in all the computers connected together add up to about 100 quadrillion (10 17 ) transistors." ([Kelly 2014:145](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=145))

"The web holds about a trillion pages. The human brain holds about a hundred billion neurons. Each biological neuron sprouts synaptic links to thousands of other neurons, while each web page on average links to 60 other pages. That adds up to a trillion "synapses" between the static pages on the web. The human brain has about 100 times that number of links—but brains are not doubling in size every few years. The global machine is." ([Kelly 2014:145](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=145))

"Think of the 100 billion times per day humans click on one web page or another as a way of teaching the web what we think is important. Each time we forge a link between words, we teach it an idea. We think we are merely wasting time when we surf mindlessly or blog an item, but each time we click a link we strengthen a node somewhere in the supercomputer's mind, thereby programming the machine by using it." ([Kelly 2014:145](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=145))

"Specialized intelligences will perform specialized tasks; other AIs will be general-purpose intelligences that accomplish familiar tasks differently from how we do. Why? Because difference makes progress. The one kind of mind I doubt we'll make many of is an artificial mind just like a human." ([Kelly 2014:146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=146))

"Currently we are prejudiced against machines, because all the machines we have met so far have been uninteresting. As they gain in sentience, that won't be true. But we won't find all types of artificial minds equally attractive. Just as we find some natural creatures more charismatic than others, some minds will be charismatic (attractive to our way of thinking) and some won't." ([Kelly 2014:146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=146))

"The universe is so huge, so vast in its available mysteries, that it will require every possible type of mind to comprehend it. The technium's job is to invent a million, or a billion, varieties of comprehension. This is not as mystical as it sounds. Minds are highly evolved ways of structuring the bits of information that form reality. That is what we mean when we say a mind understands; it generates order. As exotropy pushes through history, self-organizing matter and energy into greater complexity and possibilities, minds are the fastest, most efficient, most exploratory technology so far for creating order." ([Kelly 2014:146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=146))

"total worldwide information has been increasing at the rate of 66 percent per year for many decades. Compare that explosion to the rate of increase in even the most prevalent manufactured stuff—such as concrete or paper—which averages only 7 percent annually over decades. At 10 times faster than the growth of any other manufactured product on this planet, the rate of growth of information may even be faster than any biological growth at the same scale." ([Kelly 2014:147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=147))

"Despite its own rhetoric, science is not built to increase either the "truthfulness" or the total volume of information. It is designed to increase the order and organization of knowledge we generate about the world. Science creates "tools"—techniques and methods—that manipulate information such that it can be tested, compared, recorded, recalled in an orderly fashion, and related to other knowledge. "Truth" is really only a measure of how well specific facts can be built upon, extended, and interconnected." ([Kelly 2014:147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=147))

"there is one legitimate way in which we can claim that Columbus discovered America, and the French-American explorer Paul du Chaillu discovered gorillas, and Edward Jenner discovered vaccines. They "discovered" previously locally known knowledge by adding it to the growing pool of structured global knowledge. Nowadays we would call that accumulating of structured knowledge science." ([Kelly 2014:147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=147))

"The reason science absorbs local knowledge and not the other way around is because science is a machine we have invented to connect information. It is built to integrate new knowledge with the web of the old. If a new insight is presented with too many "facts" that don't fit into what is already known, then the new knowledge is rejected until those facts can be explained." ([Kelly 2014:148](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=148))

"Unified knowledge is constructed by the technical mechanics of duplication, printing, postal networks, libraries, indexing, catalogs, citations, tagging, cross-referencing, bibliographies, keyword search, annotation, peer review, and hyperlinking. Each epistemic invention expands the web of verifiable facts and links one bit of knowledge to another. Knowledge is thus a network phenomenon, with each fact a node. We say knowledge increases not only when the number of facts increases, but also, and more so, when the number and strength of relationships between facts increases. It is that relatedness that gives knowledge its power." ([Kelly 2014:148](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=148))

"The structure of knowledge is expanded as gorillas' anatomy is related to other animals', as their evolution is integrated into the tree of life, as their ecology is connected to the other animals coevolving with them, as their existence is noted by many kinds of observers, until the facts of gorillahood are woven into the encyclopedia of knowledge in thousands of crisscrossing and self-checking directions. Each strand of enlightenment enhances not only the facts of gorillas, but also the strength of the whole cloth of human knowledge. The strength of those connections is what we call truth. Today there remain many unconnected pools of knowledge. The unique wealth of traditional wisdom won by indigenous tribes in their long, intimate embrace of their natural environment is very difficult (if not impossible) to move out of their native context. Within their system, their sharp knowledge is tightly woven, but it is disconnected from the rest of what we collectively know. A lot of shamanic knowledge is similar. Currently science has no way to accept these strands of spiritual information and weave them into the current consilience, and so their truth remains "undiscovered." Certain fringe sciences, such as ESP, are kept on the fringe because their findings, coherent in their own framework, don't fit into the larger pattern of the known. But in time, more facts are brought into this structure of information. More important, the methods whereby knowledge is structured are themselves evolving and being restructured. The evolution of knowledge began with relatively simple arrangements of information. The most simple organization was the invention of the fact. Facts, in fact, were invented. Not by science but by the European legal system, in the 1500s. In court lawyers had to establish agreed-upon observations as evidence that could not shift later. Science adopted this useful innovation. Over time, the novel ways in which knowledge could be ordered increased. This complex apparatus for relating new information to old knowledge is what we call science. The scientific method is not one uniform "method." It is a collection of scores of techniques and processes that has evolved over centuries (and continues to evolve). Each method is one small step that incrementally increases the unity of knowledge in society. A few of the more seminal inventions in the scientific method include: 280 B.C.E. Cataloged library with index (at Alexandria), a way to search recorded information 1403 Collaborative encyclopedia, a pooling of knowledge from more than one person 1590 Controlled experiment, used by Francis Bacon, wherein one changes a single variable in a test 1665 Necessary repeatability, Robert Boyle's idea that results of an experiment must be repeatable to be valid 1752 Peer-review-refereed journal, adding a layer of confirmation and validation over shared knowledge 1885 Blinded, randomized design, a way to reduce human bias; randomness as a new kind of information 1934 Falsifiable testability, Karl Popper's notion that any valid experiment must have some testable way it can fail 1937 Controlled placebo, a refinement in experiments to remove the effect of biased knowledge of the participant 1946 Computer simulations, a new way of making a theory and generating data 1952 Double-blind experiment, a further refinement to remove the effect of knowledge of the" ([Kelly 2014:148](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=148))

"experimenter 1974 Meta-analysis, a second-level analysis of all previous analysis in a given field" ([Kelly 2014:149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=149))

"A few probable additions: inclusion of negative results, computer proofs, triple-blind experiments, wiki journals." ([Kelly 2014:149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=149))

"Evolution searches for designs that will keep the game of searching going. In this way, evolution wants to evolve." ([Kelly 2014:149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=149))

"the "evolution of evolution" is no more tautological than, say, a "network of networks," which is what the internet is. Life kept evolving for four billion years because it discovered ways to increase its own evolvability." ([Kelly 2014:149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=149))

"On the much smaller day-to-day scale, predicting the future of technology is impossible. It's too hard to filter out the random noise of commerce. We will have better luck extrapolating historical trends that in some cases go back billions of years to see how they arc through technology today. These trends are subtle, nudging technologies in a slow drift in one direction that may not even be visible in the blink of a year. They move slowly because they are not driven by human events. Instead these tendencies are biases generated by the tangle of the technium's system. Their momentum is like the gravity of the Moon, a weak, persistent, insensible pull that can eventually move oceans. Over the span of generations these trends overcome the churning noise of human infatuation, fads, and financial trends to push and pull technologies in certain ingrained directions." ([Kelly 2014:151](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=151))

"The technium is an explosion of information, organization, complexity, diversity, sentience, beauty, and structure that is changing itself as it expands." ([Kelly 2014:151](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=151))

"The elaborate system of law that undergirds Western societies is not very different from software. It's a complex set of code that runs on paper instead of in a computer, and it slowly calculates fairness and order (ideally). Here, then, is a technology that has bettered us—although, really, nothing can make us better. We can't be forced to do good, but we can be given opportunities." ([Kelly 2014:152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=152))

"How can technology make a person better? Only in this way: by providing each person with chances. A chance to excel at the unique mixture of talents he or she was born with, a chance to encounter new ideas and new minds, a chance to be different from his or her parents, a chance to create something his or her own." ([Kelly 2014:152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=152))

"Choices without values yield little, this is true; but values without choices are equally dry. We need the full spectrum of choices won by the technium to unleash our own maximum potential. What technology brings to us individually is the possibility of finding out who we are, and more important, who we might be. During his or her lifetime, each person acquires a unique combination of latent abilities, handy skills, nascent insights, and potential experiences that no one else shares. Even twins—who share common DNA—don't share the same life. When people maximize their set of talents, they shine because no one can do what they do." ([Kelly 2014:152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=152))

"Popular culture wrongly fixates on proven star roles as the destiny of anyone successful. In fact, those positions of prominence and stardom can be prisons, straitjackets defined by how someone else excelled. Ideally, we would find a position of excellence tailored specifically for everyone born. We don't normally think of opportunities this way, but these possibilities for achievement are called "technology."" ([Kelly 2014:152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=152))

"If the best cathedral builder who ever lived was born now, instead of 1,000 years ago, he would still find a few cathedrals being built to spotlight his glory. Sonnets are still being written and manuscripts still being illuminated. But can you imagine how poor our world would be if Bach had been born 1,000 years before the Flemish invented the technology of the harpsichord? Or if Mozart had preceded the technologies of piano and symphony? How vacant our collective imaginations would be if Vincent van Gogh had arrived 5,000 years before we invented cheap oil paint?" ([Kelly 2014:153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=153))

"How many people will die without ever having encountered the technological possibilities that they would have excelled in?" ([Kelly 2014:153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=153))

"technology is acquiring its own autonomy and will increasingly maximize its own agenda, but this agenda includes—as its foremost consequence—maximizing possibilities for us." ([Kelly 2014:154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=154))

"As long as the technium exists (and it must exist if we are), then this tension between its gifts and its demands will continue to haunt us." ([Kelly 2014:154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=154))

"As a practical matter I've learned to seek the minimum amount of technology for myself that will create the maximum amount of choices for myself and others. The cybernetician Heinz von Foerster called this approach the Ethical Imperative, and he put it this way: "Always act to increase the number of choices."" ([Kelly 2014:154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=154))

"Evolution, life, mind, and the technium are infinite games. Their game is to keep the game going. To keep all participants playing as long as possible. They do that, as all infinite games do, by playing around with the rules of play. The evolution of evolution is just that kind of play." ([Kelly 2014:154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=154))

"The things in life we love most—including life itself—are infinite games." ([Kelly 2014:155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=155))

"The goal of the infinite game is to keep playing—to explore every way to play the game, to include all games, all possible players, to widen what is meant by playing, to spend all, to hoard nothing, to seed the universe with improbable plays, and if possible to surpass everything that has come before." ([Kelly 2014:155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=155))

"As evolution evolves, it keeps piling on different ways to adapt and learn until eventually the minds of animals are caught in self-awareness. This self-awareness thinks up more minds, and together a universe of minds transcends all previous limits. The destiny of this collective mind is to expand imagination in all directions until it is no longer solitary but reflects the infinite." ([Kelly 2014:155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=155))

"The ongoing self-organized mutability of life, evolution, mind, and the technium is a reflection of God's becoming. God-as-Verb unleashes a set of rules that unfold into an infinite game, a game that continually loops back into itself." ([Kelly 2014:155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=155))

"The only other alternative to an endless string of creations triggered by previous creation is a creation that emerges from its own self-causation. That prime self-causation, which is not preceded but instead first makes itself before it makes either time or nothingness, is the most logical definition of God." ([Kelly 2014:155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=155))

"a single thread of self-generation ties the cosmos, the bios, and the technos together into one creation. Life is less a miracle than a necessity for matter and energy. The technium is less an adversary to life than its extension. Humans are not the culmination of this trajectory but an intermediary, smack in the middle between the born and the made." ([Kelly 2014:155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=155))

"if you believe humans are made in the image of God, the autocreator, then we have done well, because we have just birthed our own creation: the technium." ([Kelly 2014:155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=155))

"The technium is the way the universe has engineered its own self-awareness." ([Kelly 2014:156](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=156))

"The arc of complexity and openended creation in the last four billion years is nothing compared to what lies ahead. The universe is mostly empty because it is waiting to be filled with the products of life and the technium, with questions and problems and the thickening relations between bits that we call con scientia—shared knowledge —or consciousness." ([Kelly 2014:156](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=156))

"the Axial Age. It was as if everyone alive awoke simultaneously and, in one breath, set out in search of their mysterious origins. Some anthropologists believe the Axial Age awakening was induced by the surplus abundance that agriculture created, enabled by massive irrigation and waterworks around the world. It would not surprise me if we saw another axial awakening someday, powered by another flood of technology." ([Kelly 2014:156](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=156))

"Someday we will make other minds, and they will surprise us. They will think of things we never could have imagined, and if we give these minds their full embodiment, they will call themselves children of God, and what will we say? When we alter the genetics in our veins, will this not reroute our sense of a soul? Can we cross over into the quantum realm, where one bit of matter can be in two places at once, and still not believe in angels? Look what is coming: Technology is stitching together all the minds of the living, wrapping the planet in a vibrating cloak of electronic nerves, entire continents of machines conversing with one another, the whole aggregation watching itself through a million cameras posted daily. How can this not stir that organ in us that is sensitive to something larger than ourselves? For as long as the wind has blown and the grass grown, people have sat beneath trees in the wilderness for enlightenment—to see God. They have looked to the natural world for a hint of their origins. In the filigree of fern and feather they find a shadow of an infinite source. Even those who have no use for God study the evolving world of the born for clues to why we are here." ([Kelly 2014:156](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=156))

"we can see more of God in a cell phone than in a tree frog. The phone extends the frog's four billion years of learning and adds the open-ended investigations of six billion human minds." ([Kelly 2014:156](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=156))

"In a new axial age, it is possible the greatest technological works will be considered a portrait of God rather than of us. In addition to holding spiritual retreats in redwood groves, we may surrender ourselves in the labyrinths of a 200-year-old network." ([Kelly 2014:156](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=156))

"The technium is not God; it is too small. It is not utopia. It is not even an entity. It is a becoming that is only beginning. But it contains more goodness than anything else we know." ([Kelly 2014:156](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=156))

"The technium expands life's fundamental traits, and in so doing it expands life's fundamental goodness. Life's increasing diversity, its reach for sentience, its long-term move from the general to the different, its essential (and paradoxical) ability to generate new versions of itself, and its constant play in an infinite game are the very traits and "wants" of the technium. Or should I say, the technium's wants are those of life. But the technium does not stop there. The technium also expands the mind's fundamental traits, and in so doing it expands the mind's fundamental goodness. Technology amplifies the mind's urge toward the unity of all thought, it accelerates the connections among all people, and it will populate the world with all conceivable ways of comprehending the infinite. No one person can become all that is humanly possible; no one technology can capture all that technology promises. It will take all life and all minds and all technology to begin to see reality. It will take the whole technium, and that includes us, to discover the tools that are needed to surprise the world. Along the way we generate more options, more opportunities, more connection, more diversity, more unity, more thought, more beauty, and more problems. Those add up to more good, an infinite game worth playing. That's what technology wants." ([Kelly 2014:157](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=157))

"The Singularity Is Near. Ray Kurzweil" ([Kelly 2014:160](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=160))

"I call this book mythical because I think the Singularity is a brand-new myth for our age. It is unlikely to be true, but probably very influential. The Singularity is a myth much like Superman or Utopia; it is an idea that once born will never go away, but will be reinterpreted forever. This is the book that launched this indelible idea. You cannot ignore it." ([Kelly 2014:160](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SXRI9DMC?page=160))
