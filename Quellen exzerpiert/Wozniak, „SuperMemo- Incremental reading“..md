"All linear texts can assume that the reader is familiar with the preceding sections. This makes them context-poor. Within hypertext, individual texts become context-independent, and all difficult terms and concepts are explained primarily with additional hyperlinks. In the same way in which the web helped delinearize the global sources of information, SuperMemo can help you delinearize your reading of whatever linear material you decide to import to SuperMemo. While reading with SuperMemo, you will see a linear text as a sequence of sections subdivided into paragraphs and individual sentences. SuperMemo will help you provide a separate and independent processing for each section, paragraph or sentence." (Wozniak :1)

"Incremental reading begins with importing articles from electronic sources, e.g. the Internet. The student then extracts the most important fragments of individual articles for further review. Extracted fragments are then converted into questions and answers. These in turn become subject to systematic review and repetition that maximizes the long-term recall. The review process is handled by the proven spaced repetition algorithm." (Wozniak :1)

"If you do not like an article, you read just a sentence and jump to other articles. This way your attention and focus stay maximized." (Wozniak :2)

"If you encounter an interesting text in the article, select it and choose Remember extract […] This operation will introduce the extracted fragment into the learning process as an independent mini-article. […] Once you decide to stop reading the article before its end, mark the last processed fragment as the read-point" (Wozniak :4f)

"In incremental reading, interrupted reading is a rule, not an exception […] The main role of interruption is to prevent the decline in the quality of reading. Use the following criteria to decide when to stop reading the article:

lack of time: if you still have many articles for review for a given day and your time is running out, keep your increments shorter. […]
boredom […]
lack of understanding […]
lower priority […]
overload: if you have a long queue of articles to read, you will naturally read in smaller portions

(Wozniak :6)

"Each extracted paragraph or section becomes a new element that will be subject to the same reading algorithm as the original article." (Wozniak :7)

"The easiest way to recover context quickly is via references. References propagate from element to element as you produce extracts and cloze deletions. With all child elements produced from a given text marked with references, you would never need to worry about losing the context of the question." (Wozniak :7)

"A cloze deletion is an item that uses an ellipsis ([...]) to replace a part of a sentence. […] Remember cloze will convert a sentence into a specific question with an answer. By using cloze, you will move from passive review to active recall. […] For your most important material, you can create cloze items immediately after finding a piece of information that you need to remember well." (Wozniak :8)

"the learning process will intermingle reading of new articles with reviewing your items
your items will mostly have a form of cloze deletions, i.e. sentences with a question posed by a missing part [...] (e.g. The planet nearest the Sun is [...])
as the entire learning process is incremental, your cloze deletions will often show up in an unfinished form

(Wozniak :11)

"Topics keep the knowledge you want to learn (i.e. things you want to read about), while items keep the knowledge that you want to remember (i.e. the knowledge you already posses, but might forget). […] A topic in SuperMemo is an article, its part, or a sentence that you want to learn. Topics can also have a form of a picture, a video, a piece of music, etc. Unlike items, topics do not test your knowledge. They are used in passive reading, watching, or listening only. Short text topics are used to generate cloze deletions. Topics take part in the incremental learning process. Once they are converted to items, they are often dismissed (i.e. ignored in learning) or done (i.e. deleted from the learning process altogether). Both Done! and Dismiss must be executed by the user (i.e. they are not automatic). […] Item in SuperMemo is a piece of knowledge that you want to remember. It usually has a question&answer form. The main difference between an item and a topic is that an item actively tests your memory (e.g. with a question)" (Wozniak :16)

"concept […]. Such an element represents an important idea or subject. Multiple topics and items (or even tasks) can be linked to a concept. […] The concept-based network of links is called a concept map. It forms a skeleton for the spreading activation which underlies neural review." (Wozniak :17)

"Ideally, all passive texts should be deleted when done with." (Wozniak :23)

"delay the processing of those articles, paragraphs or sentences that require prior knowledge of concepts that are not known at the moment of reading. The processing of the learning material will only take place then when the new information begins to slot in comfortably in the fabric of the reader's knowledge." (Wozniak :36)

"Instead of focusing on a single subject of study, the student will review dozens of subject areas in a single day. Instead of monopolizing his or her knowledge with a single area of expertise, he or she will harmoniously deepen all facets of his knowledge in proportion to needs and/or interests." (Wozniak :36)
