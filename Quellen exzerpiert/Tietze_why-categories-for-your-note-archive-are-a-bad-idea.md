# Christian Tietze, “Why Categories for Your Note Archive Are a Bad Idea,” Zettelkasten Method, May 16, 2015, https://www.zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/.

"until your very own note-taking conventions have developed, you're confronted with making a conscious choice on every step." ([Tietze 2015:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y9UKY37B?page=1))

"throughout human history, shared taxonomies have proven useful. […] Categorizing stuff is helpful to coordinate efforts, and it's a must to make any coordinated division of labor possible." ([Tietze 2015:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y9UKY37B?page=1))

"Creating categories is a top-down process. You start with the structure and then file the material away. Notes will have to fit the structure. If they don't, there'll have to be a compromise." ([Tietze 2015:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y9UKY37B?page=2))

"The brain-Zettelkasten-fit is important. The better your knowledge management system suits the way you think, the easier it'll be to work with the things you put inside. […] Our brain doesn't work with categories, at least not initially. It may invent categories to become more efficient, but we don't start our lives on pre-existing categories." ([Tietze 2015:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y9UKY37B?page=2))

"When you learn something new, you collect information and make sense of it afterward." ([Tietze 2015:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y9UKY37B?page=2))

"This can be called assimilation: new stuff is learned in a way to make use of existing stuff. Existing neural pathways are used. This is the case when you learn the first words of a new language: you translate and remember. Then there's the mode of accommodation, where we start to change the way we think to better understand the object of our interest." ([Tietze 2015:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y9UKY37B?page=2))

"When knowledge increases, the web of things we know grows organically. Man-made structures, on the other hand, are not growing. They are built." ([Tietze 2015:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y9UKY37B?page=2))

"Topic clusters emerge by themselves, especially surrounding keywords or tags." ([Tietze 2015:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y9UKY37B?page=3))

"things are labeled in a way especially meaningful to you, not anybody else. This is all about personal information management, so personalization is a must, and increasing idiosyncrasy will likely make things better." ([Tietze 2015:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y9UKY37B?page=3))

"The only order I opt in to is creation date. […] humans remember the time of an event well, so you should order material by its date. I wanted a quick and low-tech way to answer queries like "What did I do in Spring 2011?" - Preceding dates achieve just that. That's it. But I could do without it easily."
