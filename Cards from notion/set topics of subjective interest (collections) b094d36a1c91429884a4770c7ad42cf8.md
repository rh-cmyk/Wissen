["Wenn Ideen zu Themen verschmelzen, erstelle dir Gliederungsnotizen. Eine Gliederungsnotiz ist eine Notiz, die einfach eine Folge von Links zu anderen Notizen enthält" ([Clear 2020:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SFQLIRC3?page=12))](set%20topics%20of%20subjective%20interest%20(collections)%20b094d36a1c91429884a4770c7ad42cf8/Wenn%20Ideen%20zu%20Themen%20verschmelzen,%20erstelle%20dir%20Gl%20a517cd4c9c9f47da8971d2eb2adcbc70.md)

["concept […] Such an element represents an important idea or subject. Multiple topics and items (or even tasks) can be linked to a concept. […] The concept-based network of links is called a concept map. It forms a skeleton for the spreading activation which underlies neural review." ([Wozniak :17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F9MVCIM6?page=17))](set%20topics%20of%20subjective%20interest%20(collections)%20b094d36a1c91429884a4770c7ad42cf8/concept%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D%20Such%20an%20element%20represents%20an%20importan%20976787dd5fc545d3975500df103da912.md)

["Topics keep the knowledge you want to learn (i.e. things you want to read about), while items keep the knowledge that you want to remember (i.e. the knowledge you already posses, but might forget). […] A topic in SuperMemo is an article, its part, or a sentence that you want to learn. Topics can also have a form of a picture, a video, a piece of music, etc. Unlike items, topics do not test your knowledge. They are used in passive reading, watching, or listening only. Short text topics are used to generate cloze deletions. Topics take part in the incremental learning process. Once they are converted to items, they are often dismissed (i.e. ignored in learning) or done (i.e. deleted from the learning process altogether). Both Done! and Dismiss must be executed by the user (i.e. they are not automatic). […] Item in SuperMemo is a piece of knowledge that you want to remember. It usually has a question&answer form. The main difference between an item and a topic is that an item actively tests your memory (e.g. with a question)" ([Wozniak :16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F9MVCIM6?page=16))](set%20topics%20of%20subjective%20interest%20(collections)%20b094d36a1c91429884a4770c7ad42cf8/Topics%20keep%20the%20knowledge%20you%20want%20to%20learn%20(i%20e%20t%2035e3f0faf9d547c98f52d3b3c9b1f32c.md)

["Almost always, the decision on the topic is presented as the necessary first step, after which follows everything else […] In order to develop a good question to write about or find the best angle for an assignment, one must already have put some thought into a topic. To be able to decide on a topic, one must already have read quite a bit and certainly not just about one topic. And the decision to read something and not something else is obviously rooted in prior understanding, and that didn't come out of thin air, either. Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. Basically, that is what Hans-Georg Gadamer called the hermeneutic circle" ([Ahrens 2017:48](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZYMH3KIN?page=48))](set%20topics%20of%20subjective%20interest%20(collections)%20b094d36a1c91429884a4770c7ad42cf8/Almost%20always,%20the%20decision%20on%20the%20topic%20is%20presen%20d05d2158e66f4ac9abb3df22136080ea.md)

["The consideration of how to structure a topic, therefore, belongs on notes as well - and not on a meta-hierarchical level. We can provide ourselves with a (temporarily valid) overview over a topic or subtopic just by making another note."
