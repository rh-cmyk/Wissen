Nesting

Only pages can be nested, not cards. Each card is a page, but if viewed as a page properties are not shown

Easily link cards 

linking only through property "relation" or by nesting pages

no link that is neither parent nor child ("partner")

no drag-and-drop linking

no linking multiple pages at once
