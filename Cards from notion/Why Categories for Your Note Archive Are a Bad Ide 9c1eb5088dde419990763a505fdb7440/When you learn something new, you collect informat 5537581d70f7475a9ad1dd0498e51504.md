# "When you learn something new, you collect information and make sense of it afterward. [â€¦]This can be called assimilation: new stuff is learned in a way to make use of existing stuff. Existing neural pathways are used. This is the case when you learn the first words of a new language: you translate and remember. Then there's the mode of accommodation, where we start to change the way we think to better understand the object of our interest." (Tietze 2015:2)
