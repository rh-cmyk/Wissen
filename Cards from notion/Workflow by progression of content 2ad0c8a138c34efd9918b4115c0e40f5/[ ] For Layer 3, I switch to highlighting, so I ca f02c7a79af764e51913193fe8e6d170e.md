# [...] For Layer 3, I switch to highlighting, so I can make out the smaller number of highlighted passages among all the bolded ones. This time, I'm looking for the "best of the best," only highlighting something if it is truly unique or valuable. And again, I'm only adding this third layer when I'm already reviewing the note anyway. For Layer 4, I'm still summarizing, but going beyond highlighting the words of others, to recording my own. For a small number of notes that are the most insightful, I summarize layers 2 and 3 in an informal executive summary at the top of the note, restating the key points in my own words." (Forte 2017:7)
