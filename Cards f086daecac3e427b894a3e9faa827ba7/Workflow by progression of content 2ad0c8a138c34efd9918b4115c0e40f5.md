# Workflow by progression of content

Topic: Wissensmanagement
Type: Claim

1. topic set = question/comment card
2. topic explained: cards with questions/comments (one per card)
3. source to consider
4. source to read/watch/listen to
5. quote extracted
6. quote highlighted

    maybe highlighting not necessary, summary enough

    one more step, difficult to implement technically, good summary much better than highlights

7. quote summarized
8. quote categorized: claim, evidence, definition, example

    uncategorized treated as "note"

9. content linked: drag and drop of cards onto others - sets child/parent/partner

Problem: Zettelkasten principle does not rest on progressive summarization, but on new personal insights inspired by input

new notes with idiosyncratic content are least helpful for others – if pinnacle of progression then the more progressed, the less helpful

relevance thresholds for showing content to others: lower threshold for sources, higher for notes

["Progressive Summarization [...] is a method for opportunistic compression — summarizing and condensing a piece of information in small spurts, spread across time, in the course of other work, and only doing as much or as little as the information deserves. [...] You have to summarize the note without knowing what it will be used for." ([Forte 2017:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DHH2FKWF?page=6))](Workflow%20by%20progression%20of%20content%202ad0c8a138c34efd9918b4115c0e40f5/Progressive%20Summarization%20%5B%20%5D%20is%20a%20method%20for%20oppo%20427246b679654e5488d8e4639081c9a8.md)

["Progressive Summarization works in "layers" of summarization. Layer 0 is the original, full-length source text. Layer 1 is the content that I initially bring into my note-taking program. I don't have an explicit set of criteria on what to keep. I just capture anything that feels insightful, interesting, or useful." ([Forte 2017:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DHH2FKWF?page=6))](Workflow%20by%20progression%20of%20content%202ad0c8a138c34efd9918b4115c0e40f5/Progressive%20Summarization%20works%20in%20layers%20of%20summa%200e88105ab75742f29a263e674bd9e914.md)

["Layer 2 is the first round of true summarization, in which I bold only the best parts of the passages I've imported. Again, I have no explicit criteria. I look for keywords, key phrases, and key sentences that I feel represent the core or essence of the idea being discussed. I do this bolding layer at a later time, when I'm already reviewing this note anyway.](Workflow%20by%20progression%20of%20content%202ad0c8a138c34efd9918b4115c0e40f5/Layer%202%20is%20the%20first%20round%20of%20true%20summarization,%20%204aff270672d141298a3d3ef28dbdfa7d.md)

[[...] For Layer 3, I switch to highlighting, so I can make out the smaller number of highlighted passages among all the bolded ones. This time, I'm looking for the "best of the best," only highlighting something if it is truly unique or valuable. And again, I'm only adding this third layer when I'm already reviewing the note anyway. For Layer 4, I'm still summarizing, but going beyond highlighting the words of others, to recording my own. For a small number of notes that are the most insightful, I summarize layers 2 and 3 in an informal executive summary at the top of the note, restating the key points in my own words."

["And finally, for a tiny minority of sources, the ones that are so powerful and exciting I want them to become part of how I think and work immediately, I remix them. After pulling them apart and dissecting them from every angle in layers 1-4, I add my own personality and creativity and turn them into something else."

["Incremental reading begins with importing articles from electronic sources, e.g. the Internet. The student then extracts the most important fragments of individual articles for further review. Extracted fragments are then converted into questions and answers. These in turn become subject to systematic review and repetition that maximizes the long-term recall. The review process is handled by the proven spaced repetition algorithm" ([Wozniak :1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F9MVCIM6?page=1))](Workflow%20by%20progression%20of%20content%202ad0c8a138c34efd9918b4115c0e40f5/Incremental%20reading%20begins%20with%20importing%20articles%20f0761580efb64e589cdeca1ea8930f71.md)

["Instead of focusing on a single subject of study, the student will review dozens of subject areas in a single day. Instead of monopolizing his or her knowledge with a single area of expertise, he or she will harmoniously deepen all facets of his knowledge in proportion to needs and/or interests."

["the learning process will intermingle reading of new articles with reviewing your items your items will mostly have a form of cloze deletions, i.e. sentences with a question posed by a missing part [...] (e.g. The planet nearest the Sun is [...]) as the entire learning process is incremental, your cloze deletions will often show up in an unfinished form" ([Wozniak :11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F9MVCIM6?page=11))](Workflow%20by%20progression%20of%20content%202ad0c8a138c34efd9918b4115c0e40f5/the%20learning%20process%20will%20intermingle%20reading%20of%20n%204787052fab07496f8f952f022d6d36c2.md)

["In incremental reading, interrupted reading is a rule, not an exception […] The main role of interruption is to prevent the decline in the quality of reading. Use the following criteria to decide when to stop reading the article: lack of time: if you still have many articles for review for a given day and your time is running out, keep your increments shorter. […] boredom […] lack of understanding […] lower priority […] overload: if you have a long queue of articles to read, you will naturally read in smaller portions" ([Wozniak :6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F9MVCIM6?page=6))](Workflow%20by%20progression%20of%20content%202ad0c8a138c34efd9918b4115c0e40f5/In%20incremental%20reading,%20interrupted%20reading%20is%20a%20r%20e9191e69157e4527add0fc02cdc10500.md)

["If you encounter an interesting text in the article, select it and choose Remember extract […] This operation will introduce the extracted fragment into the learning process as an independent mini-article.
