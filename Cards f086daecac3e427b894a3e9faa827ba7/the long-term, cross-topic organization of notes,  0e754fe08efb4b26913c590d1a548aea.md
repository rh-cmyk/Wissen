# "the long-term, cross-topic organization of notes, which is guided only by one's own understanding and interest, is very much at odds with the modular, compartmentalised and top-down approach in which the curricula of universities and colleges are organised. Teaching is still set up for review, and students are not really encouraged to independently build a network of connections between heterogeneous information - despite the radical change in our understanding on how our memory and learning works."
