# "If we look at the current state of education, especially the learning strategies most students employ, we see that the vast majority of all learning still aims to improve "storage strength," even though it cannot be improved. It is still mostly about remembering isolated facts and not so much about building connections. This is what learning psychologists have rightfully given the derogative term "cramming:" the attempt to reinforce and solidify information in the brain by repetition." (Ahrens 2017:95)
