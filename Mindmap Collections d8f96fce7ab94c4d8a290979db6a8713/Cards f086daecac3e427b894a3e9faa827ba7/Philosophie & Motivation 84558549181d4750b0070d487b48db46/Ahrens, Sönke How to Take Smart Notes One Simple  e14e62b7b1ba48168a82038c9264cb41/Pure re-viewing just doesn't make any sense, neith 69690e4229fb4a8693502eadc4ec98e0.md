# "Pure re-viewing just doesn't make any sense, neither for understanding nor for learning. It is debatable if we even can call it learning. It is not surprising, therefore, that the best-researched and most successful learning method is elaboration. It is very similar to what we do when we take smart notes and combine them with others, which is the opposite of mere reviewing" (Ahrens 2017:84)
