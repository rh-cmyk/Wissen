# "underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text. They will very soon become completely useless - unless you do something with them. If you already know that you will not go back to them, don't take these kind of notes in the first place. Take proper notes instead." (Ahrens 2017:44)
