# "If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing. [â€¦] Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing." (Ahrens 2017:39)
