# "In oral presentations, we easily get away with unfounded claims. We can distract from argumentative gaps with confident gestures or drop a casual "you know what I mean" irrespective of whether we know what we meant. In writing, these manoeuvres are a little too obvious. [â€¦] The most important advantage of writing is that it helps us to confront ourselves when we do not understand something as well as we would like to believe." (Ahrens 2017:81)
