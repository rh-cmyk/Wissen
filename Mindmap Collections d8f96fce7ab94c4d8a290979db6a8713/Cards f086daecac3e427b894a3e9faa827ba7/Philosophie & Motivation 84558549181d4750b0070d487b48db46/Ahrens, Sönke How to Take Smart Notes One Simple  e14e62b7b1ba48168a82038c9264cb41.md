["It is the panic in front of the blank screen that brings students and academic writers to turn to the bookshelves full of self-help books on writing, a market publishers meet in droves by focusing on how to deal with this horse-has-already-left-the-barn situation. If we take notes unsystematically, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in the midst of a deadline panic […] the myth of the blank page itself. They struggle because they believe, as they are made to believe, that writing starts with a blank page. If you believe that you have indeed nothing at hand to fill it, you have a very good reason to panic. […] the vast majority of self-help books and study guides can only help you to close the barn door correctly and according to official rules - not just a moment, but many months after the horse has already escaped."

["there is no measurable correlation between a high IQ and academic success - at least not north of 120.

["Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn't one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success."

["Even though planning is often at odds with the very idea of research and learning, it is the mantra of most study guides and selfhelp books on academic writing. How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated? It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is to structure one's workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery - or insight. Unfortunately, even universities try to turn students into planners."

["Planners are also unlikely to continue with their studies after they finish their examinations. They are rather glad it is over. Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas."

["Poor students also have no trouble finding a question to write about: they neither lack opinions nor the confidence that they have already thought them through. They also won't have trouble finding confirming evidence in the literature as they usually lack both interest and skill to detect and think through dis-confirming facts and arguments. Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as they focus on what they haven't learned and mastered yet. This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are" ([Ahrens 2017:14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZYMH3KIN?page=14))](Ahrens,%20So%CC%88nke%20How%20to%20Take%20Smart%20Notes%20One%20Simple%20%20e14e62b7b1ba48168a82038c9264cb41/Poor%20students%20also%20have%20no%20trouble%20finding%20a%20quest%2016c01cf89635437e8f5c002244881b5e.md)

["Even the best tool will not improve your productivity considerably if you don't change your daily routines the tool is embedded in, just as the fastest car won't help you much if you don't have proper roads to drive it on. Like every change in behaviour, a change in working habits means going through a phase where you are drawn back to your old ways.

["Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly […] . Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place (which is why none of the typical "10 mind-blowing tools to improve your productivity" tips you can find all over the internet will ever be of much help). The importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of David Allen's "Getting Things Done"" ([Ahrens 2017:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZYMH3KIN?page=16))](Ahrens,%20So%CC%88nke%20How%20to%20Take%20Smart%20Notes%20One%20Simple%20%20e14e62b7b1ba48168a82038c9264cb41/Routines%20require%20simple,%20repeatable%20tasks%20that%20can%20d0601689b635491b8de97e5a6fb84f39.md)

["The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. […] Unfortunately, David Allen's technique cannot simply be transferred to the task of insightful writing. The first reason is that GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition. We usually start with rather vague ideas that are bound to change until they become clearer in the course of our research […] The other reason is that GTD requires projects to be broken down into smaller, concrete "next steps.""

["Writing is not a linear process. We constantly have to jump back and forth between different tasks. It wouldn't make any sense to micromanage ourselves on that level.

["Niklas Luhmann […] One day, he put some of these thoughts together into a manuscript and handed it over to Helmut Schelsky […] He suggested that he should become a professor of sociology in the newly founded University of Bielefeld. As attractive and prestigious as this position was, Luhmann wasn't a sociologist. He didn't have the formal qualifications required even to become an assistant for a sociology professor in Germany. He hadn't written a habilitation […] He had never held a doctorate or even obtained a sociology degree. […] He turned to his slip-box and with its help he put together a doctoral thesis and the habilitation thesis in less than a year - while taking classes in sociology. Shortly after, in 1968, he was chosen to become professor of sociology at the University of Bielefeld - a position he would hold for the rest of his life. […] Luhmann, too, was asked what his main research project will be. His answer would become famous. He laconically stated: "My project: theory of society. Duration: 30 years. Costs: zero" (Luhmann, 1997, 11). […] n 30 years, he published 58 books and hundreds of articles […] Even after his death, about half a dozen more books on diverse subjects like religion, education or politics were published in his name - based on almost finished manuscripts lying around in his office. There are more than a few colleagues I know who would give a lot to be as productive in their whole lifetime as Luhmann was after his death. While some career-oriented academics try to squeeze as many publications out of one idea as possible, Luhmann seemed to do the opposite. He constantly generated more ideas than he was able to write down. His texts read as if he is trying to squeeze as much insight and as many ideas as possible into one publication. […] Luhmann rarely had any assistance at all. The last assistant who worked for him swore blind that the only help he was able to give was to spot a few typos in his manuscripts here and there. Luhmann's only real help was a housekeeper who cooked for him and his children during the week, not that extraordinary considering he had to raise three children on his own after his wife died early. […] he seemed to achieve all this with almost no real effort. He not only stressed that he never forced himself to do something he didn't feel like, he even said: "I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.""

["Even hard work can be fun as long as it is aligned with our intrinsic goals and we feel in control.

["Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998). Instead of struggling with adverse dynamics, highly productive people deflect resistance, very much like judo champions.

["So why is not everybody using a slip-box and working effortlessly towards success? […] 1. Until very recently, when the first results from the research on the file system were published, some crucial misunderstandings prevailed about how Luhmann actually worked, which led to disappointing results for many who tried to emulate the system. The main misunderstanding stems from an isolated focus on the slip-box and a neglect of the actual workflow in which it is embedded. 2. Almost everything that is published about this system was only accessible in German and was almost exclusively discussed within a small group of devoted sociologists who specialised in Luhmann's theory of social systems - hardly the kind of critical mass that would draw much attention. 3. The third and maybe the most important reason is the very fact that it is simple. Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas. They rather assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means." ([Ahrens 2017:22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZYMH3KIN?page=22))](Ahrens,%20So%CC%88nke%20How%20to%20Take%20Smart%20Notes%20One%20Simple%20%20e14e62b7b1ba48168a82038c9264cb41/So%20why%20is%20not%20everybody%20using%20a%20slip-box%20and%20worki%20c9ad5caff9b843dfa9cb617ff1f15572.md)

["Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read. […] while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: in full sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his material. More often than not, a new note would directly follow up on another note and would become part of a longer chain of notes. He then would add references to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of them which were located nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts. Some were directly related and read more like comments, others contained not-so-obvious connections. Rarely would a note stay in isolation. […] The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. The numbers bore no meaning and were only there to identify each note permanently. If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note. […] Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them. Adding a note directly behind another note is only one way of doing this. Another way is by adding a link on this and/or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system. This very much resembles, of course, the way we use hyperlinks on the internet. But, as I will explain later, they are quite different and it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper. The similarities are obviously there, but the subtle differences are what makes this system unique. […] While other systems start with a preconceived order of topics, Luhmann developed topics bottom up, then added another note to his slip-box, on which he would sort a topic by sorting the links of the relevant other notes. The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course, good entry points."

["This is the best antidote to the impeding way most information is given to us in our learning institutions. Most often, it comes in modular form, sorted by topic, separated by disciplines and generally isolated from other information.

["It is no coincidence that one of the main features of Luhmann's theory of social systems is its discovery of structural patterns that could be found in very different parts of society. For example, he was able to show how vastly different things like money, power, love, truth and justice can be seen as social inventions that solve structurally similar problems (they all can be seen as media that make the acceptance of certain communication offers more likely" ([Ahrens 2017:107](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZYMH3KIN?page=107))](Ahrens,%20So%CC%88nke%20How%20to%20Take%20Smart%20Notes%20One%20Simple%20%20e14e62b7b1ba48168a82038c9264cb41/It%20is%20no%20coincidence%20that%20one%20of%20the%20main%20features%20e0d1c16a02c84c7d9261813b6e88c602.md)

["Being intimately familiar with something enables us to be playful with it, to modify it, to spot new and different ideas without running the risk of merely repeating old ideas believing they are new. This is why it feels in the beginning that familiarity makes it harder to come up with new ideas. We just didn't know that most of the ideas we had are actually not that innovative. But while the belief in our own ingenuity decreases with expertise, we become more able to actually make a genuine new contribution. Jacob Warren Getzels and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi showed that this is also true in art: New, groundbreaking work is rarely created on a whim by some accidental artist who believes himself to be amazingly innovative. On the contrary: The more time an artist devotes to learning about an aesthetic "problem," the more unexpected and creative his solution will be regarded" ([Ahrens 2017:125](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZYMH3KIN?page=125))](Ahrens,%20So%CC%88nke%20How%20to%20Take%20Smart%20Notes%20One%20Simple%20%20e14e62b7b1ba48168a82038c9264cb41/Being%20intimately%20familiar%20with%20something%20enables%20u%2070f0e30d91804c4fb2b56fbc5cb57ccd.md)

["the long-term, cross-topic organization of notes, which is guided only by one's own understanding and interest, is very much at odds with the modular, compartmentalised and top-down approach in which the curricula of universities and colleges are organised.
