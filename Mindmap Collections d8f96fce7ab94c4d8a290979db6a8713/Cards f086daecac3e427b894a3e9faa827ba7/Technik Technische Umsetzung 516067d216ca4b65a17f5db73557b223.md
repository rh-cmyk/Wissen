["Unison, darklang, repl.it, and ObservableHQ are showing us the power of tooling and languages that treat the Web as a first-class citizen. With WASM and GraalVM on the horizon, soon we'll be able to write and run any code anywhere. We should have IDEs and languages that are similarly flexible, that can exploit modern UIs and distributed backends."

["We will need specific features like graph visualizations as well as an industrial data query language (Datalog) that can represent and operate on thousands if not millions of nodes, blocks, and edges. Knowledge at scale requires a data model that is more robust than a collection of markdown files."

["Athens has implemented bi-directional links and transclusions. This can be and has been done in under 100 lines of Clojure and Datascript."

["while a lot can be done using bi-directional links within an app, far more could be done using bi-directional links between apps. Apps today are siloed. A protocol that enables apps to securely communicate data between one another would break down these siloes."

["It's also the fact that many of these tools are built on top of a graph database. To acquire exponential returns on knowledge, we will need to be able to navigate and manipulate exponentially large datasets."
