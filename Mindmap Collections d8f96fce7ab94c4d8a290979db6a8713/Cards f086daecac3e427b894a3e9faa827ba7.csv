"""In order for a reading note to be turned into a Zettel it must un-stick from the text. It must be able to stand on its own with only a reference to the source text. You need to untangle a note from the web of text it was immersed in. This often involves rephrasing of the arguments in the source text and turning a part of this argument into its own concept. Rephrasing key arguments is a great way to integrate the knowledge and to have notes that you can rely on so you don't have to go back to the source text again. Using examples is also a way of getting the text to work for you creatively. A typical Zettel can contain the following elements: 1. A compact key statement. 2. An elaboration of the concept. 3. An example you came up with.""

"""A remaining controversy regards the historicity of Folgezetteln. Do they have a place in a digital Zettelkasten, or were they simply a by-product of the material constraints of index cards? A simple addition to a note that remains ""sticky"" is meaningless in a digital Zettelkasten, but serves a purpose in an index card based system. For a note to achieve the status of a Zettel it must be independent and be able to be a part of several sequences or relate to several notes. Likewise, a Zettel can become too sticky if other Zettelns would like to refer to a part of the Zettel. In this case, one can consider splitting the Zettel into two independent arguments with a link between them. This necessity of linking to a part of a Zettel could be used as the indicator that a Zettel has become too sticky instead of making Zettelns that are too loose by prematurely creating new ones. Another indicator that it is time to split a Zettel is that it keeps showing up in search results although you were only looking for a specific part of it.""
